#LESSONS LEARNED MANAGEMENT MODEL BASED ON THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING.

Knowledge management is the process of gathering, developing, sharing, and the efficient handling of information within an organization or project and its purpose is to ensure that the right information is available to the right people. The treatment of lessons learned one of the main inputs to achieve this purpose. Given the previous statement this paper present the development of a text analytics model (processing, classification and prediction) that allows natural language processing and through the use of artificial intelligence algorithms such as machine support vector machine (SVM), deep learning and Convolutional neural network (CNN), it shows alternatives of classification  and prediction in automatic way, associating their respective accuracy, which will depend largely on the data modeled in the given project context.
In this way, given the input of a note or observation in the documentation of a project related to the modeled database, its classification could be known automatically and give early alerts or elements for decision-making, based on a model previous training with lessons learned from previous projects
