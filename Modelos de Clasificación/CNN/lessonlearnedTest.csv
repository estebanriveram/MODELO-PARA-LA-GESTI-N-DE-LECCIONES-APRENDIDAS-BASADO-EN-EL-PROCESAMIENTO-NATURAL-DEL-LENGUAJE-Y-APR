"
10/21/1998,637,Science,,FALSE," The WIRE Mishap Review Board has determined that the telescope instrument cover was ejected earlier than planned and at approximately the time the WIRE pyro electronics box was first powered on. The instrument's solid hydrogen cryogen supply started to sublimate faster than planned, causing the spacecraft to spin up to a rate of sixty revolutions per minute over the twelve hours following the opening of the secondary cryogen vent. Without any solid hydrogen remaining, the instrument could not perform its observations. 

     The root cause of the WIRE mission loss is a digital logic design error in the instrument pyro electronics box. The transient performance of components was not adequately considered in the box design. The failure was caused by two distinct mechanisms that, either singly or in concert, result in inadvertent pyrotechnic device firing during the initial pyro electronics box power-up. The control logic design utilized a synchronous reset to force the logic into a safe state. However, the start-up time of the Vectron crystal clock oscillator was not taken into consideration, leaving the circuit in a non-deterministic state for a time sufficient for pyrotechnic actuation. Likewise, the startup characteristics of the Actel A1020 FPGA were not considered. These devices are not guaranteed to follow their ""truth table"" until an internal charge pump ""starts"" the part. These uncontrolled outputs were not blocked from the pyrotechnic devices' driver circuitry. There has been no evidence or
    indication of any component failure although component failures were considered in the investigation. 

     A significant contributing cause of the anomaly was the failure to identify, understand, and correct the electronic design of the pyro electronics box. Design errors in the circuitry, which controlled pyro functions, were not identified. The pyro electronics box design was not peer reviewed, and other system reviews conducted by the instrument design organization did not focus on the electronics box. At the time the Systems Design Review was conducted for WIRE the design of the pyro electronics box was not completed. It is the assessment of the WIRE Mishap Investigation Board that a peer review held during the design process, by people with knowledge of and expertise regarding pyro circuit design would have identified the turn-on characteristics that led to failure. 

     A large number of failure scenarios were evaluated during the investigation to determine the cause of the cover ejection. These included; pre-launch, launch, powered flight, separation, software, operations, design and component reliability faults. Based on comprehensive, systematic review of data, it was determined the cover was most likely ejected at the time the WIRE pyro electronics box was turned on due to a transient condition that exists in the pyro electronics during startup. This transient condition is the direct result of the non-deterministic initialization of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that controls both the arming and firing circuits in the pyro electronics. 

     Although some design attention was given to the startup behavior of the FPGA, the design contained unidentified idiosyncrasies that triggered the cover ejection. The system design did not contain sufficient start-up lockout protection or independent provisions to prevent the FPGA startup operation from propagating to the firing circuits. 

     The anomalous characteristics of the pyro electronics unit were not detected during subsystem or system functional testing due to the limited fidelity and detection capabilities of the electrical ground support equipment. Post-flight circuit analyses conducted as part of the failure investigation have predicted the existence of the anomaly and it has been reproduced confidently using engineering model hardware. "

6/18/1998,593,Aeronautics Research," The Mars Pathfinder (MPF) avionics and flight software development effort focused on producing a software architecture that would contribute to lower operations cost and minimize the overall project cost. This lesson summarizes MPF success factors, including use of an extra powerful flight computer and a standardized backplane and bus. ",FALSE,"  
        Use of a powerful computer (20 MIPS) with large memory for margin management provided flexibility in software development for MPF.  

        Consider use of a commercial standard backplane (e.g., VME) and avionics standard bus (such as MIL-STD-1553) to allow the fast development of realistic test environments using commercial hardware and software.  

        The early MPF risk assessments prompted the use of an essentially single string avionics design, which resulted in a great reduction in the complexity of the software.  

        A multitasking execution model permits parallel development of separate modules and is supported by a variety of commercial products.

6/17/1998,592,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Post flight testing determined that water, resulting from moisture produced during the smoldering process, provide an apparent electrical coupling between pins 9 and10 of the integrated circuit responsible for temperature compensation. The condition was repeated in the laboratory, producing the same results as those encountered in flight. Water on the card connector contacts likewise produced similar results. 

     Increasing thickness of conformal coating on the circuit board to twice that originally used verified water no longer caused the coupling problem between the integrated circuit pins 9 and 10. Additionally, circuit board and chamber connectors were sealed with RTV to prevent water incursion. 

     Conformal coating nominally used as a contamination and flammability barrier does not necessarily provide an effective electrical barrier. The need for electrical isolation should be considered in the selection of the conformal coating material and method of application, especially in humid applications. "
6/17/1998,594,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE,"  
        <i><u>Inconsistencies in Ground Testing vs. On-Orbit Configuration:</u></i> Ground testing should mirror on-orbit configuration to the maximum extent possible. Ground hardware should undergo test program as similar as possible to flight units (e.g, thermal, vibration, acoustical, etc.). For those areas that can not be made to be consistent with on-orbit configuration and/or pre-mission flight unit test program, analysis should be performed to justify and/or extrapolate test results to the on-orbit environment and flight units.  

        <i><u>Use of COTS Products Beyond Recommended Design/Operations:</u></i> The need to use a small, commercially made valve was emphasized and recommended by an independent Review Team very early in the program. The choice of the selected valve was driven by what was available in the marketplace, and by spacecraft constraints, cost, and schedule. In order to meet instrument needs, it was necessary to operate the valve outside of manufacturer's recommendations. COTS products should be carefully chosen to be consistent with system defined specifications. Testing or analysis should be performed to identify and understand risks, to the COTS as well as to the mission goals, associated with operating COTS in other than recommended manner.  

        <i><u>Use of Emerging Technology:</u></i> The selected valve was an immature, emerging-technology product line and was available through only one vendor. The original vendor is no longer producing the valve and has no remaining in-house expertise to support on-orbit anomaly analysis and resolution. Risk is expected when dealing with emerging technology; however, the customer should attempt to mitigate these risks by fully investigating the stability of the supplier, the future market of the product, and the future availability of engineering analysis support.  

        <i><u>COTS Workmanship:</u></i> Pre-mission analysis indicated inconsistent workmanship on the 3 analyzed valves. Risk mitigation was put in place on the customer side by a filtering, selection process complemented by an extensive ground test program. Additional effort should be considered to mitigate risk by partnering with the vendor to improve vendor workmanship prior to customer delivery to provide a higher quality product and/or to include an opportunity for customer inspection before a non-recoverable process (e.g., final sealing) is performed.  

        <i><u>On-orbit Mitigation:</u></i> Although the valves were recognized as a high risk element of the instrument development, no analysis was performed on a low-cost, possibly degraded, on-orbit gas control mechanism to fall back on in case of on-orbit valve failure. Given overall mission constraints, this was consistent with the approach taken for ACE. However, it is generally recommended that pre-mission analysis should include evaluation of most probable failures and the identification of low cost, degraded on-orbit back-up approaches that could result in continuing science taking in a potentially degraded mode at marginal cost.  

        <i><u>Consequence of Additional Risks of Faster, Better, Cheaper (FBC) Mission Environment:</u></i> In order to meet the spacecraft limitations, cost, and schedule envelope to fly in the FBC environment, Projects must at times accept higher risk associated with emerging technology, non-space qualified parts, and/or COTS products. Failures, likely to become more frequent in this paradigm, should be expected, accepted, and built upon as a resource to mitigate future mission risks. Required emerging technology such as these low power, low mass micro-valves should be identified to NASA technology programs as a technology to be selected for future initiatives to allow some level of test, verification, and improvement prior to operational flight.

Test facilities should have devices to maintain a safe spacecraft environment in the event of a facility power loss. ",FALSE, Unplanned power interruptions during thermal-vacuum test may cause air backflow and possible contamination and/or damage of flight hardware. 
2/12/1998,625,Science,,FALSE," The Board found that the loss of the Lewis Spacecraft was the direct result of an implementation of a technically flawed Safe Mode in the Attitude Control System. This error was made fatal to the spacecraft by the reliance on that unproven Safe Mode by the on orbit operations team and by the failure to adequately monitor spacecraft health and safety during the critical initial mission phase. 

     The Board also discovered numerous other factors that contributed to the environment that allowed the direct causes to occur. While the direct causes were the most visible reasons for the failure, the Board believes that the indirect causes were also very significant contributors. Many of these factors can be attributed to a lack of a mutual understanding between the contractor and the Government as to what is meant by Faster, Better, Cheaper. These indirect contributors are to be taken in the context of implementing a program in the Faster, Better, Cheaper mode: 

    
        Requirement changes without adequate resource adjustment  

        Cost and schedule pressures  

        Program Office move  

        Inadequate ground station availability for initial operations  

        Frequent key personnel changes  

        Inadequate engineering discipline  

        Inadequate management discipline  
    </ul>
      
      

     The Board strongly endorses the concept of ""Faster, Better, Cheaper"" in space programs and believes that this paradigm can be successfully implemented with sound engineering, and attentive, and effective management. However the role changes for Government and Industry are significant and must be acknowledged, planned for and maintained throughout the program.Since these roles are fundamental changes in how business is conducted, they must be recognized by all team members and behaviors adjusted at all levels. The Board observed an attempt during the early phase of the Lewis Program to work in a Faster, Better, Cheaper culture, but as the Program progressed the philosophy changed to business as usual with dedicated engineers working long hours using standard processes to meet a short schedule and skipping the typical Government oversight functions.

        Establish contamination control procedures for qualification test of propulsion valves. Flush the test article with freon to remove any hydrocarbon deposits. As part of these procedures, the qualification valve should be subjected to at least 5 times as many mechanical/thermal cycles as expected in flight without detecting excessive leakage.  

        Establish contamination control procedures for both flight hardware and ground support equipment. Use high purity (medical application) helium for pressure testing and for flight consumables.

2/1/1997,995,Exploration Systems,,FALSE," One consequence of the implementation of the Space Flight Operations Contract (SFOC) is a reduction in opportunities for NASA personnel to maintain detailed, day-to-day work floor interfaces with their contractor counterparts both at space flight centers and major contractor facilities. This could compromise NASA's ability to carry out its assessment function. "
2/1/1997,1029,Exploration Systems,,FALSE, The Space Shuttle program has experienced some difficulties when stable work processes were altered to counter obsolescence or meet new environmental requirements.

2/1/1997,1027,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The fan blades on the 40' x 80' x 120' wind tunnel at the Ames Research Center developed cracks after only 2,000 hours of operation. To preclude shutting down the tunnel for the 1 year required to procure and install a new set of blades, it was decided to repair the old blades while waiting for delivery of the replacements. The repair includes wrapping the root section of the blades, which eliminates the ability to detect crack growth by visual inspection. "

2/1/1997,1023,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, The use of the Matrix X autocode generator for ISS software can lead to serious problems if the generated code and Matrix X itself are not subjected to effective configuration control or the products are not subjected to unit-level V&amp;V. These problems can be exacerbated if the code generated by Matrix X is modified by hand. 
2/1/1997,1021,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," NASA's Agencywide software safety policy allows projects latitude to tailor their software safety plan for safety-critical software. It does not, however, require projects to obtain center Safety and Mission Assurance (S&amp;MA) approval of the tailored software safety plans nor does it require Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) per se.

2/1/1997,1015,Exploration Systems,,FALSE," The overall design philosophy for meteoroid and orbital debris (M/OD) mitigation has been agreed to, in principle, by the international partners. Much of the U.S. module shielding design is nearing completion. Nevertheless, there remains a finite probability that a penetrating collision will occur during the life of the ISS mission. The emphasis of the M/OD effort is therefore shifting to operations issues, such as caution and warning, damage control, and strategies for reaction to depressurization events. "

Propulsion system components should be tested for long term chemical compatibility with propellants. Heritage systems should be requalified for mission environments for which they were not originally intended. ",FALSE,"  
        Propulsion pressurization system components suitable for missions where the system is isolated after a few days may not be suitable for interplanetary missions.  

        Swelling of non-metallic components upon exposure to propellant vapors can result in propulsion system malfunction even if no chemical incompatibility exists.  
      "
1/16/1997,492,Exploration Systems," The Galileo spacecraft High Gain Antenna (HGA) was to open like an umbrella, but it never reached the fully deployed position. The failure was attributed to an inherited design of the rib retention mechanism. Recommendations involved the design of preloaded mechanisms, lubricant selection and use, hardware robustness, and fault tolerant design of one-shot, non-redundant, mechanisms. ",FALSE," Design changes intended to improve the reliability of inherited hardware may introduce new failure mechanisms. The mission impact of such design changes may best be understood through a ""physics of failure"" approach to reliability analysis. Failure physics issues relevant to antenna support bearings, for example, may include oxidation, cold welding, galling, static and sliding friction, lubrication transfer, Hertzian contact stresses, and plastic deformation, as well as operational issues such as long-term storage, ground handling, the mission environment, and mission duration.

12/19/1996,486,Exploration Systems," During lot acceptance test of ten Mars Observer pyro valves, none failed. Yet, post-test examination showed that each of these valves had sustained erosion (burning) of about 50 percent of their threads. A study showed that some firings result in the pyro being ejected from the valve body at speeds of approximately 200 m/s, which could damage critical hardware. 

     Users of NSIs should be alerted to this possibility. Acceptance or qualification testing should include post-test examination of inferred margin or incipient failure modes. The use of titanium in pyrotechnic applications should be avoided.  
     ",FALSE,"  
        Successful lot functional acceptance tests may not detect incipient failure modes without post-test examination.  

        Explosive initiators produce hot, reactive products which may create ejecta ranging from tiny debris particles to portions of the valve body, especially in the presence of titanium which is a highly reactive metal.

12/12/1996,483,Exploration Systems,,FALSE, Always use the buddy system during free dives at any depth. 
12/12/1996,485,Science," The &ldquo;most probable cause&rdquo; of the Mars Observer mission failure was identified as migration of substantial amounts of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer upstream through the check valves where it condensed on the cold tubing. When the pressurization sequence was executed upon Mars encounter, the liquid oxidizer may have mixed rapidly with fuel in the lines and detonated. The recommendations included (1) preventing hazardous propellant vapor migration and (2) performing thermal analysis of pressurization systems to identify incipient conditions for propellant condensation. ",FALSE,"  
        Interplanetary missions should provide a means to positively isolate the pressurization system from the propellant tanks when high flow rates are not required, or ensure that the effect of propellant vapor migration into the pressurization system is benign.  

        When check valves leak propellant vapors, lower temperatures upstream may cause propellant vapor condensation in the pressurization system. Perform thermal analysis of pressurization systems to identify incipient conditions for propellant condensation.

12/12/1996,484,Science," To reduce costs, the Mars Observer propulsion and other subsystems followed design practices more common to earth-orbiting satellites than to planetary missions. Consider contractor experience in bipropellant spacecraft propulsion system design in source selection. To manage risk on one-of-a-kind developments, assure thorough technical oversight of contractors with limited experience in the design of interplanetary spacecraft. ",FALSE,"  
        The differences in the operating environment between Earth-orbiting and interplanetary missions may be very significant and must be considered very early in the project design.  

        It is unrealistic to assume that contractor experience with earth-orbiting spacecraft is directly applicable to design of interplanetary spacecraft.  
      "
12/9/1996,499,Science,,FALSE, Verification of pressure status is critical when working on energized systems. 
11/21/1996,498,Science,,FALSE, Performing job hazard analyses for new tasks or jobs or ones with major modifications can identify hazards and provide information for corrective actions to eliminate or control those hazards. 
11/7/1996,480,Science,,FALSE," The overselling of the Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data capability and the emphasis on applications during Phase II and III made it very difficult to gain support for advancing the sensor and data processing technology. While serious definition studies were conducted early in Phase III, the actual development of an advanced sensor (TM) did not start until late in this phase. Also, no serious advance development was initiated on the next generation sensor: i.e. electronic scanners. "
11/7/1996,482,Science,,FALSE," Allowing Instrument teams to arrive with their GSE just prior to testing can cause delays. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and the marching army costs mount. The process of tearing down GSE and relocating the racks of equipment can cause unexpected failures and anomalies. "
11/7/1996,481,Science,,FALSE," To assure efficient and accurate testing, proper communications must occur between test shifts. Written instructions should be kept in a single designated place. Logbook entries should be recorded in a consistent format. Adequate information is essential for troubleshooting during testing. "
11/6/1996,479,Science,,FALSE," There is no such thing as a low risk heritage detector. Each detector is one-of-a-kind and should be treated as a high risk item with an appropriate amount of contingency and a good risk mitigation plan. In addition, the XTE detector problem clearly showed the value of flight spare detectors (even if degraded) which can remain on the Observatory to maintain the Mission schedule while other detectors are reworked and qualified in parallel. "
11/1/1996,535,Science,,FALSE," When parts have different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs), the shrinkage created when they are taken down to cryogenic temperature will not only produce a shear stress in the epoxy bonding them together, but it can also produce bending stresses if the mounting design is not carefully planned for cryogenic temperatures. "
10/9/1996,459,Science,,FALSE," Work documentation should reflect most up to date system configuration and specifically detail any necessary work operations to be engaged in. It was found that: 

      
        Insufficient and out of sequence, isolation, vent, and bleed procedures were specified, reviewed and approved for use. Specific work instructions trapped system pressure in the up stream leg between PCV-214 and the isolation valve VA-231.  

        Incorrect Graylock clamp removal procedures were used. Upon pressure release, the unrestrained Graylock clamps and a seal became projectiles thereby producing the injuries.  

        Personnel misunderstood the configuration and operation of the system. Dome loading pressure gauges reading 0 psi were thought to be line pressure, erroneously giving the impression that the pipe was not pressurized and was safe to work on.  
      "
10/3/1996,460,Science," Shrinkage during the curing of hard set, epoxy based, conformal coating caused cracked glass cases in many axial lead diodes in Ranger and Mariner flight computers. The lesson recommended investigating coating and bonding material properties, avoiding excessive amounts of coating, and performing post-cure inspection. ",FALSE,"  
        Unnecessary or excessive application of materials used for coating or spot bonding may have unexpected side effects.  

        Materials used for coating and spot bonding applications may have unexpected side effects. Thermosetting epoxies and others which cure to a hard, inelastic consistency may have destructive side effects, i.e. shrinkage, outgassing, unusual viscosity characteristics, tacky surfaces, etc.  

        Some coating/bonding materials go through a low viscosity watery state during the cure cycle, which can lead to slumping of the material, allowing it to run into unintended locations where its presence was not anticipated.  
      "
9/12/1996,448,Science,,FALSE," EED I&amp;T tests can appear to be successful while concurrently damaging the fusing element so that subsequent EED firing is impossible. If fusing resistor damage is not found, the result could be a launch with one or more dead EED channels. "
8/23/1996,441,Science," The exterior of MO was found to be dirty after the spacecraft had been mated to the launch vehicle. The air conditioning piping or the nitrogen purge system were the likely sources of the contamination. Similarly, deterioration of the nitrogen delivery system for Topex at a contractor facility produced heavily contaminated output. Use gas use supplies only from known, proven sources, investigate the gas supply source and delivery system, and test gases at the source and at the point of delivery. ",FALSE,"  
        Air and Nitrogen supplies are often a source of particulate and/or fluid contaminants.  

        Piping and other types of delivery systems may also be sources of contamination.  

        JPL's past experience has shown that certifications on the purity of delivered Nitrogen supplies are not always reliable.  

        JPL's past experience also has shown that although initially certified, Nitrogen at the point of usage can be contaminated.

8/1/1996,576,Science,,FALSE, Use of limit switches or position indicators are better alternatives to mechanical stops to preclude excessive mechanical movement. 
7/31/1996,638,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Contributing causes of the mishap were as follows: 

      
        Design of the system for gear stowage required technicians to break the integrity of the helium brake line after integrity had been already verified. No other check was conducted to reverify the integrity of the system after disconnection and reconnection of the line was completed.  

        Landing gear stowage was never identified as a critical process. No special steps were taken to ensure the readiness of this system for flight.  

        During the gear stowage process, there was no record of checking off steps or evidence of cross-checking of work by another person.  

        Distraction or interruption of the mechanical technician during gear stowage operations may have contributed to the nonconnection of the brake line.  
      

     The design of the DC-XA vehicle and operational procedures were driven by rapid development and low cost. Accordingly, a minimum number of personnel were involved in operations. Also, design was single string, and there was just one flight test vehicle. There was strong reliance on good people but not a lot of margin for human error afforded by the vehicle preparation process. Rapid Prototyping Guidelines or implementation thereof for the DC-XA may have gone too far in the direction of sacrificing quality and reliability. This rapid prototyping concept should be revisited from an operations perspective. "
7/19/1996,438,Aeronautics Research," Palladium is a particularly efficient catalyst for the formation of polymers. Palladium in the potentiometer wiper contacts on the Voyager Photopolarimeter Subsystem formed a frictional polymer that prevented the stepping of both the analyzer and filter wheels. 

     Catalytic material, including palladium-containing substances, should not be utilized in designs for sliding wipers, relay contacts, etc.  
     ",TRUE, Careful consideration must be given to material choices and system designs in spaceflight hardware. 
7/19/1996,440,Aeronautics Research, Delays to the SEASAT-A project demonstrated the need to prepare and submit requests for radio frequency assignments during the conceptual stage of a project. ,TRUE, Preparation and submission of radio frequency review material should be accomplished in the conceptual stage of a project. 
7/19/1996,439,Aeronautics Research," A rotating prism motor aboard the TOPEX spacecraft experienced a sudden in-flight failure due to the use of perfluoropolyalkyether (PFPE) based lubricant on titanium bearings. Pure titanium debris produced by spalling of the motor shaft chemically reacted with the fluorocarbon-based lubricant, causing polymerization of the lubricant. Avoid the use of PFPE-based lubricants on titanium or other highly reactive bearing surfaces. ",TRUE,"  
        A state-of-the-art spacecraft lubricant, with high performance characteristics throughout the operating temperature range and low vapor pressure, may be vulnerable to polymerization. In such cases, and where thin film lubrication conditions prevail, a more stable lubricant than PFPE-based lubricant should be used on moving titanium bearing surfaces.  

        Regardless of the bearing lubricant used, metallic particle contamination of bearings is likely to affect bearing lifespan. Bearing designs which reduce the amount of bearing play may reduce debris generation.  
      "
7/17/1996,432,Aeronautics Research," The MO Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs) were not powered during qualification Pyrotechnic Shock testing. As a result, the TWTA beam and cathode heaters were not powered during the critical MO tank pressurization to allow real time telemetry during this critical event. Fully consider the cost/risk tradeoff of not qualifying critical inherited designs for new operational uses. ",TRUE," Unless precluded by solar system obstacles, a spacecraft should be configured to allow real time telemetry during critical events. Such telemetry may provide crucial spacecraft health and safety data for other spacecraft missions with similar systems or activities as well as for the current mission. "
