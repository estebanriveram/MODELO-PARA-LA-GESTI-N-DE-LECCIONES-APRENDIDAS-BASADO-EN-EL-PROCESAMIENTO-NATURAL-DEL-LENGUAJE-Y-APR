6/6/2014,9501,Aeronautics Research,"  Power system distribution at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) consists primarily of high-voltage, underground cables. These cables include approximately 5000 splices.¾ Splice failures result in arc flash events that are extremely hazardous to personnel in the vicinity of the arc flash. Some construction and maintenance tasks cannot be performed effectively in the required personal protective equipment (PPE), and de-energizing the cables is not feasible due to cost, lost productivity, and safety risk to others implementing the required outages. To verify alternate and effective mitigations, arc flash testing was conducted in a controlled environment. The arc flash effects were greater than expected. Testing also demonstrated the addition of neutral grounding resistors (NGRs) would result in substantial reductions to arc flash effects. As a result, NGRs are being installed on KSC primary substation transformers. The presence of the NGRs, enable usage of less cumbersome PPE and increase the",TRUE,"  Laboratory testing revealed higher than anticipated safety risks from a potential arc-flash event in a manhole environment when conducted at KSCês unreduced fault current levels.¾ The safety risks included bright flash, excessive sound, and smoke.¾¾ Due to these findings and absence of other mitigations installed at the time, manhole entries require full arc-flash PPE.¾ Furthermore, manhole entries were temporarily restricted to short duration inspections until further mitigations could be implemented.¾ With installation of neutral grounding resistors (NGRs) on substation transformers, the flash, sound and flame energy was reduced.¾ The hazard reduction was so substantial that the required PPE would be less cumbersome and enable effective performance of maintenance tasks in the energized configuration.¾  
  With the NGR installed, the surge arresters currently used at KSC are not designed for the load and may fail during a fault causing secondary outages and increasing repair times.¾ Replacement of the surge arresters will be conducted over 2-3 years due to the resulting hundreds of facility outages and impacts. Until the surge suppressors are upgraded, the NGRs would only be used during manhole construction and maintenance operations in an approved outage period. "
3/11/2014,8018,Human Exploration and Operations,"  The sampling and analysis processes, used to verify cleanliness of gases and liquids loaded into payloads and related Ground Support Equipment (GSE), were introducing an unacceptable level of process induced contamination. The process induced contamination often necessitated multiple resampling and extensive analyses to develop confidence of clean commodity. ",FALSE,  The particle contamination monitoring was insufficient to provide meaningful feedback to ensure operating protocols were successful in maintaining cleanliness levels.¾ 
2/18/2014,8701,Aeronautics Research,"  An operator error involving mis-probing during a safe-to-mate procedure, in which a breakout box (BOB) was used, resulted in a short circuit and a blown fuse. Patching or probing of electrical connections to sensitive hardware that involve a BOB should be done with extreme care after double-checking the BOB connections. ",TRUE,"  The common use of BOBs during subsystem/system integration and test does much to facilitate hardware checkout and test procedures, but the BOBs also expose developmental hardware or spaceflight hardware to an additional risk of test-induced damage. "
1/21/2014,8017,Human Exploration and Operations,"  The Restore Project obtained excessed equipment from the Space Shuttle Program and used this heritage equipment in a test setup.¾ The equipment was marked and tagged for Nitrogen Tetroxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) service.¾ During testing, a leak occurred because one piece of the equipment had a seal installed that was incompatible with N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.¾ The project should have required additional inspection and seal replacement for this equipment, which was obtained from excess. Programs or Projects using legacy heritage equipment from another Project or Program should implement a –trust but verify” strategy towards legacy equipment.¾ ",FALSE,"  Implement a –trust but verify” philosophy when using components and assemblies obtained from uncontrolled sources such as excessed components and assemblies.¾ The Project should imposed rules requiring disassembly, inspection and seal replacement in assemblies acquired from uncontrolled sources. "
12/3/2013,8601,Aeronautics Research,"  The JPL focus on primarily one-of-a-kind flight systems and missions may result in insufficient priority placed on design documentation and mission-centric knowledge retention. The OCO-2 project found the inherited Orbiting Carbon Observatory design to be poorly documented. Assure that the spaceflight project retains the design knowledge needed to duplicate a system design. Train employees at all levels to recognize the value of project-generated knowledge and to champion its retention, sharing, and reuse. ",FALSE,"
    Reflight of a system design is becoming a more common JPL practice. For example, the Mars 2020 mission concept under study by NASA would duplicate the successful design of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. (If the prospective Mars 2020 flight system is not designed as an exact copy of MSL, it would likely retain major MSL elements like the Descent Stage; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) design; and Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG)). In addition, NASA is supporting the use of common spacecraft buses (e.g., LADEE, Cubesats) that will facilitate reflight of a standard flight system design.   
    
    The JPL focus on primarily one-of-a-kind flight systems and missions may result in insufficient priority placed on design documentation and mission-centric knowledge retention. However, much technical knowledge gained over the course of a JPL project is reusable, and the actual reflight of a spacecraft design is not uncommon (e.g., Mars Polar Lander/Mars Phoenix, Jason-1/Jason-2/Jason-3, OCO/OCO-2, Mars Science Laboratory/proposed Mars 2020 mission). Even modest efforts to husband technical knowledge may reduce the cost of future projects, even ones that are not planned as build-to-print, by making the knowledge reusable.   
  "
10/18/2013,8016,Human Exploration and Operations,"  Three employees were exposed and two additional employees were potentially exposed to hypergolic oxidizer Nitrogen Tetroxide/Nitrogen Dioxide (N2O4/NO2) and experienced some degree of nasal and/or skin irritation. The hypergolic oxidizer leaked from a flex hose (F/H), one of 12 Hypergolic Propellant Servicing System (HPSS) F/Hs at the Water Waste Support Building (WWSB) outdoor storage area located in the KSC Industrial Area. ",FALSE,  Clean up technicians were unaware of the contaminated hypergolic flex hose and were not the correct personnel to be performing the pickup. 
10/15/2013,8501,Human Exploration and Operations,"  Thermal-vacuum testing of a Ka-side frequency multiplier for the Juno Small Deep Space Transponder (SDST) was interrupted in mid-performance when a desktop computer running the test unexpectedly sought to download an update of an installed software package. While the flight hardware and test equipment were not harmed, eight hours of test data were lost. Verify that test support equipment critical to tests or experiments cannot be interrupted by extraneous computer processes or external commands. ",TRUE,"  Many computers used for specialized purposes in test facilities are general purpose computers that may also be configured to perform office functions. Processes extraneous to flight system testing (e.g., code updates, scheduled file backups, e-mail downloads, and security scans) may occur intermittently on these units without user interaction or knowledge, particularly when they are connected to institutional networks. Should an extraneous process interrupt an active test, significant test time may be lost and the test article or support equipment may be damaged. "
8/6/2013,8403,Aeronautics Research,"  Following thermal-vacuum bakeout/testing, various Mars Science Laboratory aluminum parts exhibited flaking of the black anodize coating. The flaking was traced to a known problem with Type II anodization of 2000 and 7000 series aluminum alloys. Although these coating failures were not significant for MSL, contamination from such debris poses a potentially significant mission impact. Use of Type III anodize or paint instead of Type II anodization is recommended on series 2000 and 7000 aluminum. ",FALSE,"   
    Type II black anodization of aluminum is commonly performed by JPL and by industry to provide a durable coating for corrosion control or to minimize glint for cameras. Although anodizing aluminum alloys by this technique is usually successful, the compatibility of certain aluminum alloys with the Type II anodize process is unpredictable. Although the coating failures caused no damage to MSL, contamination from the resulting debris can potentially have serious mission consequences.   
    
    There is some evidence that factors such as exposure of the anodized surface to extreme low-side temperature cycles (e.g., to -130C), and the deep thermal cycling associated with planetary protection measures, may affect the tendency of the coating to spall. For component surfaces that experience relatively benign total thermal variations, or for missions that do not require planetary protection bakeout, it may be feasible to specify and deliver a reliable Type II black anodize coating on 2000 and 7000 series aluminum alloys for a given flight project.   
  "
7/23/2013,8402,Human Exploration and Operations,"  An in-flight anomaly occurred because the Kepler battery charge control algorithm was not designed to cope with the changes in the roll rate that the spacecraft experienced, nor was the dynamic behavior of the spacecraft adequately modeled. Assure that flight control algorithms have adequate margin to deal with all mission phases and operational scenarios. ",FALSE,"  When designing flight control algorithms, such as battery control algorithms, the design must cover all phases of the mission, including post-separation detumble. For Kepler, this constituted a failure to (1) model dynamic spacecraft behavior during all operational phases so that they could impose the proper flow-down of requirements to the power system, and (2) test-as-you-fly and demonstrate margin. "
6/25/2013,8401,Science,"  The Orbiting Carbon Observatory project was unable to generate simulated science data that covered all critical operational modes, which impacted the completeness of system testing. Early in the project lifecycle, project management should define which science datasets, both simulated and captured, will be required for use during system testing. Project management should also require the Project Element Managers to collaborate in defining these needs. ",FALSE,"  Simulated science data is needed by multiple groups within a project team to test their respective SDPS elements. Even though the specific needs of each group may vary, a cooperative effort among the different groups may reduce the amount of time required to generate an adequately complete set of simulated data for system test. If the project fails to plan the timely generation of a complete set of simulated data, system testing may be unable to verify and validate all critical operational modes. "
6/4/2013,7176,Aeronautics Research,"2010 was a significant year for NASAês James Webb Space Telescope Program.  The National Academy of Sciences Astronomy Decadal Survey reaffirmed that completing the Webb Telescope was the nationês top astronomy priority. At nearly the same time, Senator Barbara Mikulski, a long-time Webb advocate, requested an independent review of the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, as the JWST Program was beginning a replan due to its continual budget troubles.

When an independent panel of experts published its review of the Program in October of 2010, its members recommended the Project shift from focusing on technology development to managing the Webbês life cycle cost and launch readiness date, with the Project getting more visibility inside NASA by reporting directly to the Goddard Center Director and the Program reporting directly to the Agencyês Associate Administrator. This lesson describes changes in the JWST Program Office's approach to management and the resulting positive outcomes, recognizing that the telescope still has years of fabrication, integration, assembly and test ahead.",FALSE,"Once the program was put on a sound foundation for development through launch with the JWST rebaseline in 2011, NASA had to address the management issues identified by the independent review panel. The new JWST Program Director describes changes in five areas that have led, thus far, to considerably improved telescope development performance. The areas are:

  clearly defined authority, responsibility and accountability;  
  improved communication;  
  commitment to the established baseline;  
  improved risk management;  
  independent review and increased program planning and control capability and analysis.

5/28/2013,7156,Aeronautics Research,"Penetrating into a building subsurface requires special precautions to minimize the potential of coming across a visually hidden hazard, and the consequences should such a hazard be encountered. Recommendations are outlined to avert such a situation.",TRUE,"      Using out of date or unintelligible building drawings to guide potentially hazardous work is comparable to not consulting any drawings at all. This practice actually increases the risk of exposing personnel to hazards since the work is unjustifiably considered to be safe or controlled. Consequently: a. A hazard analysis should be performed when a standard control is compromised or suspect. 

      Critical safety requirements and processes may be undermined and overlooked if they are placed in the appendices of a document, they do not provide sufficient implementation details, or if they reference non-existent documents. 

      Halting a penetration operation and investigating it when there is a change in backpressure or ejection of an unexpected material is a good practice that can prevent a serious injury.     "
4/29/2013,7076,Exploration Systems,During Program or Project Life Cycle Reviews such as the Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program System Requirements Review/ System Definition Review (SRR/SDR) details of review execution can make a big difference in how stakeholders perceive the review. Lessons Learned were identified during execution of GSDO SRR/SDR. Some of these lessons are positive (things done well) and some were areas for improvement.,FALSE,"Providing paper or electronic copies of presentation materials to reviewers prior to the kickoff or Board meetings would allow people to have better access to the material during meetings. Reviewers may have difficulty seeing the presentation. Some reviewers want to read the presentation prior to the meeting. Identifying the Standing Review Board (SRB) needs ahead of time - paper copies of review materials, work areas for their discussions or other accommodations, is helpful. When conducting comment disposition meetings or panels, the review team must ensure that teleconference and online meeting/ web conferencing information are clearly posted on the review portal ahead of time so everyone can easily find this information. Review teams and panels should post agendas on the review portal that show topics and their allotted time slot. Sometimes people are supporting different meetings and activities and they need to know what time a particular subject is slated for discussion so they can ensure they are in the right place at the right time. The best practice would be to have  agendas for these meetings updated to the review portal during each of the meetings. It is important that the review support team members be available to work issues and be responsive to requests for help. Attendees frequently have questions or need information."
4/18/2013,8302,Human Exploration and Operations,"  A JPL Operations Working Group convened in November 2010 to review in-flight spacecraft command file errors and identify measures to mitigate the impact on mission operations. The group briefed those projects approaching launch and early cruise operations on their findings and recommendations. Projects entering Phase E, or entering post-launch periods of increased operational tempo, should consider these proactive steps to minimize command file errors. ",FALSE,"  Experience since JPL began tracking command file error trends in 2000 suggests:  
   
    Command file error rates increase during launch and early cruise operations, along with times of increased operations tempo (encounters, orbital operations) and execution of first time events.   ¾   
    Each project needs to proactively balance the risk of command file errors, as compared with other project risks and project resource constraints, in evaluating the recommendations listed below.

4/16/2013,7096,Exploration Systems,"After a NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) Assessment of the use of International Space Station (ISS) European-manufactured modules that did not receive post-proof weld non-destructive evaluation (NDE), significant lessons were learned relating to the use of Leak Before Burst (LBB) criteria versus safe-life criteria as a design tool for complex fracture critical welded structures.",FALSE,Complex fracture critical welded structures should be assessed using safe-life analysis techniques that utilize post-proof NDE results and incorporate weld drawing/specification allowables.
4/9/2013,7036,Exploration Systems,"During the time period between late calendar year (CY) 2005 and the middle of CY 2007, a member of the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) Guidance Navigation and Control (GN&C) Technical Discipline Team (TDT) provided specialized engineering technical support to the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Orbital Express (OE) Demonstration System mission. An NESC report, A Summary of the Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, Docking, and Undocking (RPODU) Lessons Learned from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Orbital Express (OE) Demonstration System Mission, was published at the conclusion of this assignment.",FALSE,"The following lessons learned summarize the knowledge or understanding that the Automated Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D) community of practice (COP) has gained from the OE experience. For a more detailed explanation of each Lesson, the NESC final report referenced in the abstract should be reviewed.        System designers and operators should be mindful of implicit assumptions concerning the availability of a navigation state. 
       Infrared (IR) sensors can enhance system robustness to unanticipated lighting variations. 
       A coupling between sensor and navigation software is susceptible to mutually reinforcing problems. 
      To achieve an effective sensor calibration on-orbit, the target vehicle should not be present in the sensorsê fields of view, and possible sources of image corruption should be included.
       Situational awareness imagery can be critically important in aiding the ground operations teamês recovery from an abort, and since ground-based assets provide limited coverage, providing such data via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) should be a system capability.
       The navigation filter must be able to identify and screen out erroneous sensor data without affecting the filterês processing of valid sensor data.      "
3/15/2013,7016,Space Operations,Data Sanitation and Verification for hard drives prior to excessing can be performed several different ways. The current method has some challenges and required workarounds.,FALSE,"Performing data sanitation and verification can be done many ways. Using the DBAN software directly has several issues and requires workarounds. The DBAN.iso image would not run without errors. Searching forums online located several workarounds. We received a 'No drives found' message which required us to edit the script called Main, search for SD_FOUND and modify the /dev section to say /dev/cciss. Then, modify the sd[a-z] to say c0d[0-9]. At this point, the Main script would run on some servers. Some servers would fail with the message /dev/cciss/c0d0 (process crash). We researched several workarounds and found that the best solution was to load the shareware software Parted Magic before running DBAN. This combination ran without problems and the disks were validated to have been sanitized."
3/12/2013,6977,Exploration Systems,"During Program or Project Life Cycle Reviews such as the Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program System Requirements Review/System Definition Review (SRR/SDR) the choice of review tools and how they can be used is important. Easy to use, intuitive tools for collecting and disposition of comments can help with review success.",FALSE,"   Positive finding: Having a centralized portal for all materials related to the lifecycle review is important. This portal should be opened prior to review kickoff. 

  Area for improvement: the review portal needs to be updated frequently during the course of the review with meeting minutes and meeting agendas (especially for lower level panels). 
     Area for improvement: The review portal should have a document search capability to make it easy to locate products to be reviewed.   </ul>
 
     Positive finding: A tool for collecting, updating and dispositioning comments was used for the GSDO SRR/SDR. It is important that this tool be very easy and intuitive for all commenters, comment sponsors and administrators. 
  Area for improvement: It is important that comment status and disposition be immediately updated and available at the review portal. Once a Board or Panel makes decisions the comment tool should be updated the same day if possible.

5/21/2012,6976,Exploration Systems,"Space Shuttle Transition and Retirement activities required major efforts and challenges to manage and disposition large quantities of Government real and personal property over a limited schedule. Property disposition involved Centers and Prime Contractors. While NASA has property management requirements in place, Center as well as Prime Contract approaches to meet the overall requirements vary. Also, major efforts were made to coordinate and transfer property to Centers and/or future programs with changing demands. Innovative tasks were implemented to reduce schedule and costs.",FALSE,"The prime contractor took several opportunities to help reduce cost to the Transition and Retirement (T &  R) program as well as to reduce schedule. The following improvements implemented in the September 2011 time frame helped the prime contractor become more efficient in the Property Excess process. 

  Approval to stage tooling in locations outside of bonded stores allowed more work to be accomplished simultaneously and minimized the limitation of available space in the Excess warehouse. 

     NASA requested on the prime contractorês behalf and received a waiver from Defense Contact Management Agency (DCMA) to allow the prime to exceed a requirement without punishment. The requirement involved the 30-day time limit to dispose of property once a disposition is given. The contractual requirement involving the 30-day limit spawned another requirement that limited the number of entries allowed into the property transition/disposal system, the Plant Clearance Automated Reutilization Screening System (PCARSS). The document designated for entering an item for transition/excess is a DD1149. To comply with the requirement, a DD1149 could only be written and input into the system to cover the amount of property that could be Excessed in a month. For example, if it took 1 person 1 day to excess a bin, the maximum number of bins that could be excessed in a month was 20-25. One DD1149 could be written to excess only those 20-25 bins. To excess all 635 bins, 24 to 28 DD1149ês would have to have been written and processed. DCMA took, on average, 60 to 90 days to run each DD1149 through the PCARSS system. With the waiver, they were able to front load the system, entering one DD149 for property, such as the 635 bins. The 635 bins took 3 to 4 months to prepare for Excess. Frontloading significantly reduced the amount of data entry, redundant paperwork, and coordination required, reducing the lag time between prime contractor and DCMA activities. 


     RSRM had some property that was used in direct contact with rocket propellant. Special procedures, called 5Xing, to clean the hardware are required prior to transferring or excessing hardware to someone outside the company. Front loading the system reduced the processing time needed to start, as well as streamlining the schedule after approval. 

     Eliminating the need to re-tag material with paper tags by allowing PKAB (RSRM) tags to be equal to R006 (SLS) upon transfer completion streamlined the process of transferring hardware between contracts. Property ownership transfer records were made electronically in the material database (Impresa). This reduced the amount of physical labor and quality control required to re-tag all internally transitioned hardware. 

     Bringing in temporary employees by hiring former employees with the needed experience to expedite closeout efforts in the prime contractor warehouse known as Stores. Utilizing former employees with the specific knowledge, experience, and skills regarding hardware and other property helped the T&R team meet an aggressive Excessing schedule and accelerated the completion of transfers. 

     An IT team led by the Property Disposition team built a time-saving bridge from the prime contractorês system, Impresa, to DCMAês PCARSS, which streamlined the material entry process to a single date entry task for each property unit instead of repeating the same data entry task into each property management system. 

     In the Materials Excess review process, the time allowance for Program Management review was reduced from 10 days to 5 days. Unnecessary steps were also eliminated, reducing the wait time throughout this review process.   </ul>"

The analysis was completed without being verified by the subcontractor or prime contractor that the analysis methodology and assumptions complied with contractually stipulated verification data deliverable requirements.

8/8/2011,6349,Space Operations,"The interaction of rocket exhaust plumes with the external vehicle flowfield has been the source of numerous problems on the Space Shuttle _ both on the launch vehicle during ascent and the orbiter during re-entry (which, from a System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) point of view, is relevant to ascent aborts). Experience throughout the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) has been that plume induced effects are almost always detrimental to vehicle performance or operational efficiency. While modern computational methods have evolved significantly since the beginning of the Shuttle program, the nature of plume/flowfield interactions stretches the capability of even the most complex computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Ultimately, plume interaction effects are typically very challenging to simulate and predict _ whether analytically or empirically _ and, as a result, the accuracy of these predictions is generally subject to relatively large uncertainties.",FALSE,See attached document
8/3/2011,6036,Space Operations,"A gaseous hydrogen (GH2) leak occurred on 03/11/09, during the STS-119/ET-127 cryogenic loading for flight, and was repaired with a –fix to fly” approach by replacing the flight seal and the Ground Umbilical Carrier Assembly (GUCA) quick disconnect (QD. There was no attempt to determine the cause of the leak before the repair. An anomaly resolution team was assembled after the launch to determine the long-term approach. <br/><br/>

In successfully mating the GUCA QD to the External Tank Carrier Assembly (ETCA), the following factors play key roles: Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUPC) concentricity, QD probe/flange concentricity, two-piece seal, the GUCA QDês Inconel bellows, vent line loads, alignment between the ETCA and the flight carrier plate, alignment of the hinge support brackets, and the pyrotechnic bolt. Of these eight factors, GUCP concentricity and QD probe/flange concentricity can be adjusted within limitations. <br/><br/>

Attached to this lesson is the GUCA GH2 Leak Investigation White Paper, which provides details of the investigation and process changes.<br/><A HREF=""https://nen.nasa.gov/llis_lib/pdf/1044856main_GUCA%20GH2%20Leak%20Investigation%20White%20Paper.pdf""  >Click to view white paper</A>",TRUE,"The most important lesson learned from these GH2 leaks is the need to understand and control process creep. Near the end of the Shuttle Program and after Hurricane Katrina hit Michoud Assembly Facility, KSC received several ETCAs whose configurations were out of tolerance. Some hinge brackets showed evidence of offset and slight clocking, and in some cases, the plate itself showed clocking. These minor deviations in assembly created enough of a stack-up problem to prevent the GUCP from tracking with the ETCA. Even though master tooling was used to manufacture the ETCA components, slight variations (which could have been avoided) were allowed to be introduced because the components were installed without the use of any indexing tooling. <br/><br/>

Another important lesson is the possibility of unintended consequences when design changes are implemented. The CRES 321 bellows was replaced with the Inconel 718 bellows to eliminate a fatigue problem and to reduce the number of parts and the refurbishment time. But the Inconel bellows was less able to track with the out-of-tolerance ETCA component installations. This change also added an unknown variable that was discovered during the investigation. Each bellows seemed to take a set during the QD assembly operation (minor offset from the flange to the probe). When the QD was stacked up with the out-of-tolerance ETCA and GUCP offset (misalignment), the cumulative concentricity differences among the components prevented the assembly from sealing at cryogenic temperatures. <br/><br/>

Another lesson is the importance of concentricity between the sealing surface and the bellows probe, as well as the rest of the assembly that could have an effect on it. The closer the concentricity offset between the sealing surface and the bellows probe is to 0, the more able the system will be to comply with (accommodate) external forces (e.g., vent line loads, wind, weather, and cryogenic loading). This understanding was instrumental in resolving the problem of the out-of-tolerance ETCA installations since the flight side could not be modified. For a critical fluid interface, the design should be such that the system excursions are experienced away from the sealing surface. The GUCA was designed to pivot about the pyrotechnic bolt, which caused the sealing surface to be dynamic. The sealing interface should have been maintained by solidly attaching the GUCP to the ETCA and allowing the flexhose to handle all the system excursions. In addition, the sealing interface was a single seal with no secondary sealing capability. A redundant seal configuration would have increased the systemês compliance to excursions. Also by having a primary and a secondary seal, along with a leak check port, a better ambient leak check could have been performed. The leak check port would have greatly increased the fidelity (smaller leak check volume) and would have allowed for the use of a helium mass spectrometer, which can detect small leaks. On all GH2 leak anomalies, an ambient leak check of the system was performed, and no leakage was observed until cryogenic loading on launch day. The ambient leak check could verify only that the system didnêt exhibit extreme misalignmentãit wasnêt a good metric to determine if the installation was acceptable for cryogenic loading."

The outer mold line (OML) of future spacecraft should be as clean as possible, and all protuberances and cavities should be eliminated or minimized. Definition of induced design environments for the Space Shuttle Vehicle presented a significant technical challenge when considering that in order to properly establish them, there was a need to not only define the detailed surface pressure distributions on protuberances and cavities, but also the aeroheating environment and the dynamic or fluctuating pressure field generated by these geometric features. Further, the presence of these protuberances and cavities generate effects on the near flow field as well as on surrounding surfaces. The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) embarked on the definition of these induced environments through analytical methods, subscale ground test of the mated vehicle as well as component level, and also numerical simulations.

Two conditions were identified where it is possible for free potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte to creep between the cell stacks and to establish an undesirable conductive ionic pathway that effectively shorts out one of the two cells within the CPV. Those conditions are: 1) activating the NiH2 CPV cells with excess electrolyte present or 2) allowing the cells to reach very low states of charge during operation. Based on observations and available data, once the electrolyte bridge is established there are no effective means to eliminate the problem with the possible exception of fully reconditioning the battery cell, or at least extended operation (up to a few weeks) in an open circuit condition. </br>

2/2/2011,5296,Exploration Systems,"Physical mockups were used to perform a human factors analysis to improve the ground processing of the Constellation Programês (CxP) Ares-1 and Orion, verify ground processing requirements for flight hardware, and validate ground activities. The inclusion of infrared motion capture analysis with the physical mockups improved the human factors analysis and also helped to facilitate development of detailed work instructions and improve training materials. Analyses were accomplished by first developing a timeline of events that included each activity, and then each activity was analyzed by operability and human factors experts with spacecraft processing experience. A human factors analysis tool was adapted for this activity. Several human factors and operations experts were brought together in a small team to perform this analysis. Following each issue discovered during the analysis, the necessary analysis design engineers were brought into the process to address the issue for design improvements.",FALSE,"   Physical mockups were a great way to analyze and verify the ground processing requirements for flight hardware and to validate the ground activities.

The analysis was performed by operability and human factors engineering experts with spacecraft processing experience.",FALSE,"Timeline analysis is a great way to analyze and improve the design of ground and flight hardware interfaces for ground processing of the ground equipment and the flight and ground hardware interface. Using the visualization process (i.e., where the operations personnel meet with design visualization personnel in the design visualization lab to develop the flight, ground support equipment (GSE), and life-size human animations and pictures) was important because these animations were very helpful to the human factors and other engineers during the Human Factors Operability Engineering Analysis (HFOEA). 
 

   Some examples of evaluations performed on human/system interfaces were:
  The task of moving the short stack pallet into and out of the servicing bay was evaluated. Communication and visibility by the operator to the pallet corners for alignment of pallet into the bay were considered issues. An action was taken to assure a method was put in place to prevent contact and misalignment of the pallet with the existing bay structure during installation/removal of short stack pallets. A human factors requirement was evaluated and applied to the task that states, –Users shall be protected from making errors to the maximum possible extent.” 
     The task of connecting, disconnecting, and stowing hoses from a transporter was evaluated. The weight and flexibility of the hoses were considered issues. An action was taken by the team to assure the hoses could be lifted by the technicians. Human factors requirements for maximum weight of units of equipment to be carried by more than one person were assessed. If a unit of equipment is designed to be carried by two people, the weight carried by either one of them shall not exceed 19 kilograms (kg) (42 pounds (lbs)); thus, if the weight of the unit is distributed uniformly, the maximum weight of the unit is 38 kg (84 lbs). This limit applies to carrying distances up to 10 meters (33 feet). 
     The task of removing guard rails from short stack pallets was also addressed. The issues, similar to the hose issues described above, were for the weight and size of guard rails. An action was taken by the team to assure the guard rails could be lifted by the technicians. Similar human factors requirements applied.   </ul>

12/6/2010,4436,Aeronautics Research,"The Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program Office recently completed a System Requirements Review (SRR), System Definition Review (SDR) (per NPR 7123.1) and an Independent Life Cycle Review (ILCR) Program Approval Review (PAR) (per NID 7120.5) from May, 2010 - August, 2010 in preparation for Key Decision Point (KDP) I which takes the Program from a formulation phase to an implementation phase. During these reviews, some lessons learned noted were; 
  Use review success criteria as a basis for the review agenda   
  Ensure that the scope of the review is well communicated to all parties   
  Arrange for a neutral party to observe during the review and provide feedback to the program/project office.   </ul>",FALSE,"Planning: 

  The Program utilized its draft Program Plan as an outline for the PAR based on benchmarking with other loosely coupled Agency programs. In hindsight, we would have served the Standing Review Board (SRB) better if we had developed the outline and agenda based on the review success criteria as detailed in NPR 7120.5 Section 2.5.4 and any success criteria noted in the Terms of Reference (TOR) Document.   

   Know your audience! The SRB is an independent board formulated by the HQ Independent Program Assessment Office (IPAO). Once we had the names and titles of people confirmed as SRB members, it would have served us well to have a detailed meeting with all presenters so that they were well aware of who would be in attendance, their areas of focus, and the key issues they might look to understand.   

   The more dry runs, the better. The Program held several dry runs, a table top review with each individual presenter as a first glance at draft charts, a dry run of charts with the entire Program Office present, an ""in-situ"" dry run held at the actual location of the event (very helpful to  ensure your administrative support is familiar with AV equipment and that support need requests can be submitted in a timely fashion), and a chart run-through with Directorate management. However, it is recommended to include someone with Program or Project management experience who is familiar with Program or project reviews and completely independent from the office to take a fresh look at the chart package and how it will be presented. (If done right, this could take up a person's entire day, so make sure that person has time and is willing to commit that time to helping out.) Another dry run that could be scheduled is specifically a ""tough questions"" session in order to prepare presenters and also come to a common office understanding of how to answer particular questions.   

   Determine early in the planning process what is in and out of scope of the review and hold to that. SRB members may want to investigate an area that is outside of the scope of the review and it is completely appropriate to ensure that the scope of the review is understood and adhered to. IPAO can assist with this agreement in the Terms of Reference Document.   

   Make sure there is a lead integrator who knows the content of the presentation extremely well. Program management is focused on answering questions, and this function is necessary to facilitate the meeting especially when the SRB may want to skip topics or jump to particular topics.   

   Scheduling an outside activity or two for an independent board was encouraged and appreciated, but do this early in the review. Once they get into the main part of the process, they will get busy and probably work well into the evenings to complete the review on time, depending on the agenda laid out for them.   

   Ensure all stakeholders/Program or project participants or representatives of those participants are present for a review of this proportion. This may mean Headquarters personnel (Program Executive or Director) or outside external agencies or other centers or matrixed personnel who are pivotal and key to your Program or project.   

   If possible, have a neutral party present during the review. This should be someone who knows something about the Program or project but isn't necessarily directly involved. This allows things like real-time feedback so that adjustments can be made and also ensures valuable post-review feedback.   

  Provided a pre-brief of the PAR material to functional line and programmatic line management, such as the HQ Program Executive and Director.   

   Pay attention to repeat information. A certain amount of that is fine (for example showing the same chart a couple of times in different locations) to make sure the audience is familiar with key information. But, too much repetition could lead to a perception of ""glossing over"" certain key information, so strike a good balance with chart integration.   

   Emphasize to presenters that they thoroughly know the content of what they are presenting.   

   Ensure that a comprehensive chart package is pulled together using the same formatting and template. Our review had multiple presenters providing multiple chart packages. Provide a format up front for all to follow, but then have a chart making expert on staff put the final package together. Do not underestimate the time it takes to do this and do it well. RPS started producing charts for this review in early July for an August 30 review and it was a difficult to complete in that timeframe. Allow 2 or more months for chart preparation.   

   The amount of time and effort to plan and execute a review of this magnitude was underestimated.    </ul>

Review: 

   If an SRB wants to spend more or less time on particular topics, be flexible. Be prepared, but be willing to ""call an audible"" real time in order to ensure the SRB is focusing on key topics.   

   One of the unwritten goals of a review like this is to build credibility with the SRB which means being forthcoming in answering questions and providing information.   </ul>"

A simple piping fix could reduce this risk if the lower cavity where leaking hydrogen gas can accumulate were designed to purge residual hydrogen to well below the critical level.  This would prevent the condition where hydrogen in the GUCP cavity causes a launch scrub.
11/1/2010,6149,Exploration Systems,Residual hydrogen in the fill and drain line during the terminal count down sequence could lead to a catastrophic failure. The best practice is to connect the purge line to the propellant line as closely as possible to the dead headed end of the line to ensure complete purging on the line.,FALSE,Residual hydrogen in certain locations in feed systems for liquid propulsion can create potentially catastrophic conditions at launch.  Piping design and plumbing practices affect the integrity of purge systems to completely purge critical propellant lines.  The allowance of a length of piping between the helium injection connection to the dead-headed end of a hydrogen line does not allow the helium gas to purge all hydrogen vapor from the lines prior to launch.  Experience on the Space Shuttle Program suggests the best practice is to connect the purge line to the propellant line as closely as possible to the dead headed end of the line to ensure complete purging on the line.

Besides the normal certification testing criteria for what is classically considered failure modes for passive system elements, the effects of manufacturing defects, improper cleaning and drying, storage, handling, operational use and collateral damage should also be taken into account when determining their in service maintenance requirements and life. Also when using metal bellows flex hoses in an application where the hose extends and retracts it is important to ensure that the minimum bend radius is not exceeded and that there is no induced reverse bending occurring during the entire travel of the hose. It is very difficult if not impossible to detect, by inspection, impending reverse bending fatigue failure of the metal bellows convolutes that occurs due to storage, handling, operational use ( hoses that are routinely disconnected and connected ) and incidental collateral damage."

9/29/2010,4021,Space Operations,A change to the design of a new drive installed on the high-bay elevators in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at the Kennedy Space Center caused all the elevators to fail the minimum slide-distance test. Features of the new drive design had altered system parameters.,FALSE,"The VABês high-bay elevators were upgraded from generator-controlled to DC-drive-controlled elevators. The new units use encoders on the motors to determine the speed and position of the elevator in the hoistway. The position encoder feeds data to the programmable logic controller (PLC) about its location. When the elevator was signaled to stop during the slide test, the PLC caused the drive to start decelerating to what is termed the approach speed.  It seemed the PLC was sensing a more abrupt change than was actually occurring. This effect brought the elevator to a stop sooner than intended. Adjustments to the procedure eliminated the unintended deceleration. Since then, every elevator's 5-year safety slide test has performed within allowable scope."

The Prime operated without a Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) for a year while under letter contract.  Letter contract definitization can take months/years to occur, and during that time NASA projects have little insight into contract performance.  Additionally, there is a tendency for contractors to delay establishing a PMB, even an interim PMB, prior to contract definitization.   Without an interim PMB, it is difficult to determine current performance, assess technical, cost or schedule risks/impacts and planning and control by both the prime contractor and the government is diminished.",FALSE,"Prime contractors must comply with the EVM System and reporting requirements included in Letter Contract awards and projects should only allow waivers to these requirements due to extreme circumstances.  This includes the initialization of the PMB, submission of the CPR and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), and conduct of the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) to the extent practical within 180 days after award (in accordance with the contract EVM clause).

9/23/2010,4256,Space Operations,"Leak checks utilizing a mass spectrometer have been an effective method of validating the integrity of fluid systems within the aerospace industry for decades.  Mass spectrometers provide a high fidelity leak check, however, unlike soap solution or flow meter leak checks, there isn't a sensory method to validate correct performance of a mass spectrometer leak check.  Where a soap solution leak check can be validated visually by looking for the presence of bubbles or a flow meter leak check can be validated with a pinch test of the leak check tubing, proper performance of a mass spectrometer leak check relies on maintaining equipment in current calibration, correctly performing pretest and post test checks when putting the equipment in use, and most importantly, ensuring personnel using the equipment are properly trained.",FALSE,Proper maintenance of equipment and training of personnel are of vital importance in ensuring the integrity of leak checks performed with mass spectrometer units.  Detailed processes and procedures for using the equipment must be developed and carefully followed.
9/21/2010,4477,Space Operations,"System-level leak checks can validate the integrity of a system and are more efficient, less intrusive, and less time-consuming than individual component leak checks.",FALSE,"For complex fluid systems that contain many components, an overall system leak test can be used in lieu of individual component internal leak checks to validate the integrity of the system. This type of leak test typically involves pressurizing the system, configuring its fluid components to lock up pressure in all or part of the system, and then monitoring for a decay in pressure. Total overall leakage from the system can be calculated using the system volume and measured decay rate.    

For systems with multiple components in series, more than one test may be required to validate the entire system. A system-level decay test typically is less intrusive than multiple component-level leak checks; and in most cases, the allowable decay for the system can be established so that the decay test would fail if a major component has more internal leakage than is allowable. In addition to saving time and resources, this type of test offers the benefit of detecting gross external leakage from a damaged component such a cracked line or ruptured flex hose.    

A system-level decay test acts as a good integrity check that the system is ready for use. A system-level decay test is typically not meant to replace component-level leak checks performed to test a replaced component; however, if the component-level check is not possible or practical, the system-level leak check may give adequate confidence that the system is functioning properly. If the system-level leak check detects an anomaly, further testing could isolate the leakage to an individual component."

9/20/2010,4618,Aeronautics Research,"A major problem in designing a cryogenic system in a spacecraft or launch vehicle is avoiding back-pressure buildup, which will affect the ability to service and deservice the vehicle with cryogenic reactants. Servicing lines should be sized adequately for an existing baseline system; then the baseline tubing should be oversized to accommodate increased fluid flow rates that can result from new equipment or changes in requirements. If these accommodations are not part of the initial design, servicing or venting paths may need to be added later.",FALSE,"Oversizing cryogenic (or other) commodity lines in a spacecraft to accommodate higher flow rates is an advantage, but the future need for more capacity must be likely in order to justify the additional cost and weight."

Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) FCPs have been developed that can use propellant grade reactants. This means that a common liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen system could potentially be designed for both propulsion and electrical power generation requirements as well as for Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS).  This would simplify cryogenic loading operations by getting rid of extra pad clears and load operations for the FCP Power Reactant Storage and Distribution (PRSD) system and potentially consolidating into one ""cryo load.""

A math model designed and populated as the program evolves would also help to define problems more precisely and generate better focused solutions. Proposed changes would be less risky and more efficient. A system adequately instrumented with lower-cost (and, where possible, noninvasive) maintenance parameters, in addition to flight-critical vehicle and GSE measurements, would provide data with enough depth to be of real value in evaluating system performance.

It frequently takes several attempts to successfully mate the QDs. Often it appears that the GHC is successfully mated to the AHC, only to find out later that the mate was not successful. The weight, orientation, and degree of twist of the hose relative to the QD make it difficult to lock the connection in place, even by pulling on the hose.

8/16/2010,4056,Science,"The coolant and hydrogen circulation pumps in the Space Shuttle Orbiterês fuel cell power plants (FCPs) are powered by external AC power. However, these external AC inverters are fed by the Orbiterês main DC busses, which are directly fed by DC power supplied by the fuel cell itself. On two separate occasions, an FCP was inadvertently removed from the main DC bus, causing the associated AC inverters (and hence the coolant and hydrogen circulation pumps) to lose power. This caused a potentially dangerous overheating condition within the fuel cell. A better design would be to power all internal critical components with the fuel cellês own internal DC power. Future designs should either use DC rotary equipment to power the fuel cell, use internal AC inverters and power the FCP with the DC power that the fuel cell produces, or utilize passive (non-powered) thermal control methods.",FALSE,"Having the FCP obtain the electrical power it needs to run its pumps from the spacecraftês electrical system creates an inherent risk to fuel cell operation.

8/3/2010,3456,Exploration Systems,"There are many insulated fluid lines in the propulsion systems of the Shuttle orbiter. One such propulsion system is the Orbiter Auxiliary Power Units system, which contains many insulated fluid lines with embedded active components. These insulated fluid lines contain thermostats and heaters for temperature control. Many of these thermostats must be stimulated with a cold or hot source if the need for a functional retest is flagged during a functional path verification such as the Connector Integrity Group/Shuttle Connector Analysis Network (CIG/SCAN). To gain access to the thermostats, some of the insulation must be displaced. This activity has led to damage of the insulation, electrical leads, or heater elements.

8/3/2010,3656,Space Operations,"The booms and joints of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) are covered with thermal blankets to help protect the electronics and joint components on orbit. These blankets are attached with Velcro and are grounded to the RMS by ground wires. Instead of as-built drawings for the RMS thermal blanket system, the vendor provided a template, which could be used to create additional templates for all other blankets. Cartoon drawings identified where to connect the Velcro and ground wires. The vendor outsourced the blanket manufacturing and repair to a subcontractor who in turn used these inaccurate cartoon drawings to manufacture and repair the thermal blankets. We often found blankets that do not fit correctly because of incorrect Velcro placement and ground wire locations. Such blankets are unusable.

7/29/2010,3697,Aeronautics Research,"During stowage and functional checkout of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) at Pad B in support of STS-77 and after an Interim Problem Report (IPR) was generated for a separate problem, it was found that the two Contamination Control Cartridges (CCCs) were installed backward in the two EMUs (EMU 1 and EMU 2). This raised the concern that lithium hydroxide (LiOH) from the CCCs might have entered the EMU vent loop or that mechanical damage might have occurred. After PR initiation and disposition, it was determined that no LiOH had entered either of the EMUs and that no collateral mechanical damage had occurred. The CCCs were then reinstalled in their correct configuration. To prevent this from happening again, the installation drawings and procedures were updated to be more specific in the installation process. This CCC reverse installation has not recurred.",TRUE,"The CCC, as originally designed, could be installed only one way. The redesign, which eliminated two off-center ports, allowed the CCC to be installed backward. The only design criteria levied at the time for a correct installation was ""Correctly orient flight CCC, such that the identification tag is visible when installed."" Since this check did not limit the physical installation of the CCC, it could still be inadvertently installed backward. A change to the redesign was suggested, but because of the cost of any redesign to the EMU system, it was decided to add another check and a Caution note to the installation process. Since these changes were implemented, this CCC reverse installation has not recurred."

Benefitting from careful planning starting more than a year before the launch campaign, the WISE project responded to the rapidly and continually changing environment in which launch preparations take place. WISE made careful preparations for contingencies and launch campaign uncertainties, prepared for unanticipated logistic challenges arising shortly before launch, anticipated differences in launch crew culture and engineering practices, established lines of communication, and managed the inevitable launch anxiety.",TRUE,The launch window durations for JPL and NASA payloads are typically narrower than for many military and even commercial missions.

7/19/2010,3276,Exploration Systems,"Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) is a material that can withstand the high temperatures of reentry and can be used in areas where greater durability is desired. When RCC is exposed to high temperatures, it oxidizes rapidly, so a coating is required to reduce its exposure to oxygen. Reactions with these coatings can cause subsurface voids in the RCC. To accurately inspect and assess the condition of the RCC, a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is required to see under the outside coatings. Thermography is one method that was utilized for RCC inspections.

7/13/2010,3357,Exploration Systems,"The Shuttle Orbiter Data Processing System (DPS) was originally designed to technologies of the 1970s. Over the Shuttle Program's life, many of the system's capabilities were improved. However, the end-to-end system, including the ground checkout consoles and associated software, has limitations that led to ground processing inefficiencies. The flight systems were upgraded with new capabilities, whereas the related ground systems were not. This resulted in inefficiencies that occur during checkout and operation of the DPS. These DPS problems were first documented in ""Shuttle Avionics Design Constraints & Considerations Guide Book,"" dated April 25, 1995 (attached), and were updated to reflect recent experience. Also, attached is a photo showing the installation of the ground-use-only video camera for remotely monitoring the feed from the DPS Multifunction Display Unit during ground checkout.",FALSE,"       When flight system capabilities are improved (e.g., from tape-based MMUs to new solid-state mass memory), the corresponding ground systems should be improved (e.g., LPS data buffer and launch data bus handshaking time) to gain the full efficiencies offered by the new flight capabilities. 
      The inability to remotely select edge key actuation of MEDS from the firing room console or GOAL application programs makes it impossible to automate the checkout of MEDS or include reconfiguration in the DPS Console Set software, resulting in DPS ground processing inefficiencies. 
      Adding the capability to remotely monitor the flight MDU displays and providing the capability to route the video off the vehicle would greatly enhance DPS processing and troubleshooting during ground processing.

7/2/2010,3379,Exploration Systems,"Redundancy can create significant flexibility in systems, but flexibility within critical support systems can significantly increase the risk of human error. Testing and training on these systems through simulation must also be carefully managed.",FALSE,"Systems that support critical operations are typically designed with redundancy and flexibility that allows testing to continue in the event of significant hardware failure (Fail-Ops). The LPS is augmented with enough hardware to support launch countdown in this manner. However, much of this hardware is not needed on a day-to-day basis. To maximize support capability, strategies have been developed that take advantage of this additional hardware; chief among them is the split-set function wherein one Firing Room is used to support two (or more) concurrent operations. The benefits of this flexibility can be significant, but come with significant risk. The likelihood of human error is increased when multiple tasks are supported from one location, and it is often impossible to prevent problems on one set from propagating into the other. <br/>
 <br/>
Of particular concern are simulation activities and software testing, because it can be difficult for the user to discern whether the system is connected to a simulator or to actual hardware. During software validation and simulations using the Space Shuttle LPS, commands have been inadvertently directed to both ground support equipment (GSE) and flight hardware. Both system configuration and situational awareness issues have contributed to these errors. Vulnerabilities increase when hardware testing and simulation exercises are conducted on shared systems. <br/>

  The IDC purge components were not designed to prevent overpressurization, which caused system failure.  
   Instead of a Bepco enclosure pressure control valve, a Bepco control panel rapid-exchange valve was used to control GN2 system purge. This allowed the rapid release of overpressure, which in turn caused the system to fail.   
  The IDC single-stage regulator was found to have vibrated open, causing the inlet pressure to increase (creep) to 50 psi. The nominal operational pressure setting is 10 psi. This increase in the inlet pressure setting allowed the system to become overpressurized and caused the system to fail.   
   The IDC camera head enclosure lid was not sealed properly because of ground wire interference, which caused a differential in system pressure between enclosures.  
  The bottom clip on the IDC camera battery, power supply, and power supply enclosure were seated but did not catch the enclosure door, which contributed to system purge leakage.  
  NASA lab personnel completed measurement testing before the ICD was put into operational use. However, purge system operation and functional checkout were not performed, which prevented detection of system overpressurization before operational use.  
  The current operational procedure, MDA Prototype Ice Detection Camera User Manual Rev 4.0, was not followed. Use of that operational procedure might have prevented the system overpressurization. A new local procedure for field use will be developed containing all operational steps, notes, cautions, and warnings.

Failure analysis was performed and concluded that the corrosion was caused by high levels of chloride in the procured ammonia and that the shutdown was due to high levels of polyethylene oxide (PEO) in the propellant-grade ammonia. Since the switch to higher-purity, technical-grade ammonia, there have been no ammonia boiler leaks or shutdowns.",FALSE,"High levels of chlorides in propellant-grade ammonia attack the base metal of the boiler (347 stainless steel) and initiate pitting corrosion.

5/17/2010,2837,Exploration Systems,"Due to extremely tight tolerances, rigging of the Orbiterês Manipulator Positioning Mechanism (MPM) required the use of instrumentation to set some of the mechanical components. This greatly complicates and lengthens the rigging process. It also increases the risk of failures/problems because of a higher likelihood of the system being improperly adjusted. It also makes the system more susceptible to problems in flight because of thermal and zero-G effects that cannot be screened for during ground checkout. Designs need to be robust enough that rigging tolerances of a few thousandths of an inch are not necessary.",FALSE,"Requiring such tight rigging tolerances on the mechanical components created several problems and made the process of rigging the mechanisms very complex. The team decided that the best way to determine the on-center position of the linkage was by monitoring the load in the drive rod. Theoretically, the load should peak at the on-center position. In order to measure this so that the stop could be set within the required 0.002 inch tolerance, a linear transducer was installed on the drive bellcrank, and strain gauges were attached to the drive rod. Testing on the flight hardware showed that because of friction and other inconsistencies, the location of the peak load varied depending on the speed at which the linkage was cycled and the direction (stow or deploy). The team eventually decided that the on-center position would be based on an average of the positions of the stow and deploy peak loads, weighted toward the stow position. However, the amount of variability in this measurement resulted in some risk that the stop bolt position would not be set within the required range. The design of the hardware should not require this level of accuracy to ensure proper operation. Additionally, the team found that other seemingly minor things had an effect on the performance of the mechanism. It was discovered that the way the pedestal assembly was attached to the test stand made enough of a difference that it caused it to exceed some of the spec limits. This was because of minor deflections in the base plate of the assembly because of how it was secured to the stand. Also, such tight rigging requirements make the system more susceptible to problems in flight. During ground checkout it is not possible to simulate all the conditions the hardware will experience on-orbit. The effects of zero-G and thermal changes cannot be screened for on the ground. During the first few flights after the modified MPM hardware was installed, there were some problems with the performance of the limit switches. Even during prelaunch operations at the pad we found that the limit switches transferred differently than they did during horizontal processing in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). In flight, some of the limit switch indications did not come on during the cycles but then transferred on some time later. These were believed to be because of thermal effects on orbit. Eventually the specification was updated, and the limit switch rigging was relaxed to account for these issues."

Silica-glass-based fabrics are primarily used for this application. Heat cycles on these materials tend to make them stiff and brittle, resulting in parts that are susceptible to damage from both flight and processing operations. New ideas to address this design requirement need to be explored. For the Space Shuttle Program, configuration changes were made that greatly improved process operability, but the basic design has remained unchanged. From stand-point of flight safety, a single thermal barrier does not supply redundancy, and that risk must be accepted.",FALSE,"The soft goods necessary to seal door interfaces are very susceptible to wear and tear and require a high level of maintenance.

<br/> One example of the value of wire harness IDs in the Shuttle Program is the ability to determine the wire function using only the wire ID. A worst-case scenario is wire damage detected during final closeouts, and when post repair requires a functional retest. If the function is unknown, there are two ways to resolve this condition: perform extensive hardware removals to isolate the wire function or perform functional retest of all wires in the harness. A complete functional retest of all the wires in the harness may not be possible if it contains functions that cannot be retested in the vertical configuration. In this case, it would cause flight hardware removals to isolate the function. The removal of flight hardware in final closeouts would likely drive a slip in the planned launch date. Depending on the vehicle design, this issue could result in the de-stack of the vehicle. <br/>
<br/>The Orbiter has experienced many cases of wire damage just prior to flight, and wire IDs were invaluable in resolving the issues quickly without impacting the planned launch date."

During the intervening time when the technicians were evacuated, the open storage tank released an estimated 12,236 cubic feet of oxidizer vapor into the atmosphere. A number of personnel were exposed to the vapor in the downwind area.",FALSE,"Because there is no design to prevent the release of propellant when the storage tank relief valves are removed, effective scheduling of an operation to accomplish the removal is essential. Plan the task for winter when the propellant will be colder. Maintenance at temperatures below 68 çF on N2O4 storage system will greatly reduce the boil-off of N2O4. <br/> 
<br/> 
Nominal maintenance items on hypergolic storage vessels that will require replacement or calibration should be designed in such a way that will allow maintenance or calibration to be done while not requiring major hazardous operations or the need to completely drain the storage vessel of propellant. Since ASME code does not allow an isolation valve in front of a relief valve, a design with more than one relief valve with a three-way isolation valve will allow compliance with the code and also allow isolation of one relief valve for maintenance. <br/>
<br/> 
In this design, the tank is always protected by a relief device and the design allows for the purging of the off-line relief valve pipe and the replacement of the relief valve as a minor hazardous operation. This design also allows for the annual calibration to be accomplished with the RV installed. Processing costs are reduced and personnel and the effect on the environment are controlled. The importance of effective and correct evaluation of outstanding ESRs is demonstrated in this case. If the effect on the environment of the annual replacement and the risk to personnel was correctly evaluated and acted upon, then this event could have been eliminated. Combine this with the proper planning of the calibration and implementation of the modification to occur during cold weather, and the amount of released propellant could have been minimized."

The RMS shoulder brace was cycled and left in the latched position for flight. The required visual inspection for quality verification was reported as nominal. During the on-orbit checkout, the shoulder brace was released for operation. It was during this release that the crew reported a quicker than expected release (2 seconds instead of 5 to 8 seconds). Troubleshooting revealed that the requirements used to verify the shoulder brace latch prior to flight were not as accurate as thought. Historically, console program VAB40 was used to provide the data for the shoulder pitch angle prior to latching the shoulder brace. The requirement for shoulder pitch angle was 0.0 ± 0.1 degrees in order to latch. Troubleshooting revealed that the pitch angle must be 0.0 ± 0.07 degrees in order for the shoulder brace collet to engage. VAB40 only provided a resolution of one decimal place.

5/4/2010,2839,Exploration Systems,"Reduced torque output of the orbiterês electromechanical actuators has been a problem for the Shuttle Program. It has resulted in unplanned work to test, remove, and refurbish the actuators. Disassembly and inspection has revealed that the torque reduction is a result of problems with the torque limiters and the motor clutch/brake assemblies in the actuators. Refurbishment is a lengthy process because of the difficulty involved in setting the torque limiter to operate through the required temperature range. The next generation of actuators should have a better design, or the mechanical system should be capable of withstanding the maximum output loads of the actuator.",FALSE,"The torque limiters of the External Tank door actuators were redesigned in the early 1990s because of unacceptable degradation of the disk friction surfaces. The new design was a multidisk ball-ramp setup. When the torque reached a certain value, the ball-ramp design reduced the compression load on the disk stack and allowed the disks to rotate relative to each other (slip). The disks in this particular actuator were made of steel and Vespel. After several years of service with the new torque limiter design, most of the actuators exhibited reduced torque output. Investigation determined that the torque limiter degradation was due to grease contamination of the disk surfaces. Inspection confirmed that excess grease was applied to some of the torque limiter components (bearings) during assembly and eventually migrated to the disk surfaces. However, even after the actuators were refurbished, excess grease was removed, and the grease was cleaned from the disks, the actuators often continued to exhibit torque degradation and show evidence of grease contamination of the disks. Another problem was the amount of effort required to set the torque limiter to slip in the required range when the actuator was being serviced. The value at which the torque limiter slips depends somewhat on the temperature, and the actuator is required to operate with a specified torque output through a large temperature range (over 300 çF). Several rounds of adjustments were needed, each followed by days of testing. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, there was degradation of the motor clutch/brake assemblies in these actuators. Each actuator has two AC motors, each of which interfaces with the gear box differential through a clutch/brake assembly. For redundancy, the actuator will operate on only one motor. When a motor is not operating, the clutch/brake assembly is in the brake mode. A friction disk is spring-loaded against a stator, which locks the input to the differential and disconnects it from the motor. This is necessary so that during single-motor operation, the nonoperating motor input is not back-driven through the differential. When the motor starts up, the assembly switches to clutch mode. A solenoid pulls the disk away from the stator, separating the brake surfaces and engaging the clutch surface of the disk to the motor output. The motor then drives the differential input through the clutch. During tests of the actuators on the vehicle, the torque output varied significantly by motor mode. Since there is a single torque limiter, the point at which it slips should be the same regardless of which motor is operating. This indicated that the clutch/brake assembly was slipping prematurely. Disassembly and inspection confirmed that both the clutch and brake surfaces were worn. There was evidence of scoring on the interfacing surfaces and metallic debris in the assembly."

Logistics agreed that TCS parts would be stored in boxes and sealed with integrity labels, with a box content sheet (generated from the TCS Blanket Management System [TCSB]) and a bar-coded label affixed to the outside of the box.

Kitting was developed to process parts with many detailed sub-assemblies while maintaining the assembly kitted together for later issuance and re-installation.

4/27/2010,3039,Exploration Systems,"The Thermal Control System (TCS) tracking system has been in use since 1989 under the Shuttle Processing Data Management System II (SPDMS2). It was enhanced in 1992 to support the first Orbiter Maintenance Downtime Period (OMDP) for the Shuttle Orbiter Discovery (OV-103) at KSC and reduced processing rates to 33 TCS blankets in 15 minutes, with a program savings estimated at $90K per flow. In 2006, a conversion from the original LSOC1 program to Oracle brought many more enhanced features. This system greatly enhanced processing of over 35,000 parts in the TCS inventory, both in the vehicles and in Logistics.  <br/>
<br/>
Under the previous system, a Work Authorization Document (WAD) had to be altered for each unique part. The WAD provided basic instructions that met the minimum installation requirements, but did not deal with issues specific to the individual part being installed. During high-volume parts processing (involving thousands of TCS blankets and their supporting structures or carrier panels), it was noted that the part tag did not contain all of the information and detailed requirements necessary. As a solution, a new type of part tag, called a –traveler,” was developed. With the traveler, the tracking system can fill in the data for each unique part without the need for a separate WAD. The traveler contains all the basic information found in a part tag, plus the additional information needed for tracking and processing. During processing, a removed part is tagged to identify its part number, serial number, and condition, and space is provided for a quality inspection stamp and date. Information on the authorizing document and next higher assembly may also be entered.",FALSE,"Although using part tags works well if a single item or a handful of items is being processed, it does not work well when a large number are being processed. To use part tags in high-volume processing, the WAD must either contain detailed steps for each part or a matrix must be used to ensure each partês requirements are met. <br/>
<br/>

For the new process, each part was assigned a unique bar code, a database was created with information on each part, and a new form (the blanket traveler) then captured any additional information or requirements pertaining to the bar codes associated with it. The traveler was developed to replace both the part tag and the IPD sheet. <br/>
<br/>

Travelers offer a number of advantages over part tags. The traveler captures the detailed installation requirements from the drawing. It details the condition of each part, as well as the state (installation, etc.) of the part. It also contains buy-offs for all steps required to process the part (e.g., removal, inspection, approval to install, completion of installation, torque, and grounding). Unlike part tags, travelers can associate a part with a particular vehicle, installation drawing, or zone, or with a WAD for removal/installation; reflect when a part is installed; and show the final location of the part. The traveler may include references to Material Review (MR) conditions and reference the MR WAD number or one-of-a-kind work steps and buys. <br/>

A travelerês information can be readily updated or corrected, and the information for the specific part can be printed."
4/27/2010,2838,Exploration Systems,"The effects of soft goods (environmental seals, pressure seals, thermal barriers, etc.) were not fully considered during the design of several of the orbiter mechanical systems. During rerigging efforts at KSC, it was not possible to meet all the requirements in the drawings/specifications because much of the initial rigging was done without the installation of these soft goods. Loads induced by the soft goods prevented the mechanisms from operating within the required ranges. This was most evident during the rerigging of OV-103ês landing gear after the Columbia accident. The design process should ensure that the loads of soft goods are understood and considered. Also, field rigging specifications should be developed to allow for rework of the system postdelivery.",FALSE,"There were no requirements to verify the seal compression. Proper compression was assumed based on meeting the door-to-structure flushness requirement. There was also no requirement to verify the height of the seals. There was a postflight visual inspection only.<br/> 
<br/>
Attempts to adjust the mechanism to obtain the proper seal compression and door position confirmed that the mechanism was not capable of overcoming the loads of the seals and other soft goods without exceeding other parameters of the rigging specification. Ultimately, some parts of the mechanism were instrumented to ensure that the loads in the critical components remained within acceptable limits. In addition, after the STS-114 rerigging effort was complete, small changes in seal or thermal-barrier stiffness (when components were replaced) resulted in unacceptable changes in the door positions. This often resulted in extensive testing and rework in subsequent flows. There were similar problems with other orbiter mechanical systems, including the ingress/egress hatch and External Tank umbilical doors. <br/>
<br/>
 Furthermore, when the system was reworked in the field, it was not always possible to comply with the mechanical rigging specifications. The specs were written from a manufacturing perspective, and often the seals and other Thermal Protection System components were not installed. Following the spec in the field was not always practical because it required that the hardware be returned to the original build configuration.

However, RF data is often very noisy and can be further degraded by vehicle exhaust plumes. These factors preclude the effective use of predefined bit sync parameters. To eliminate this problem, RPS started recording the PCM signal in analog (unprocessed) format, eliminating all PCM signal processing and the potential for invalid data."
4/25/2010,2956,Space Operations,"Instead of using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment to replace the ground instrumentation data acquisition system (Permanent Measurement System [PMS]), NASA and its contractor designed the Ground Measurement System (GMS) in-house. As the result of a technology transfer effort, GMS was manufactured by a commercial vendor. The design of GMS was still undergoing changes during its implementation at the pad. Several components of the system never became fully operational. These complications eventually led the Ground Instrumentation department to replace GMS with a COTS implementation (GMS2/CDAS).",FALSE,"It would have been beneficial to capture the end-userês requirements prior to the design phase. GMS encountered several roadblocks and the need for major design changes during attempts to implement the system. One component of the system, which required many work hours of troubleshooting, never attained full functionality. In addition, one of the advertised benefits of GMS was the ability to locate the signal conditioning and amplifier circuitry near the transducer or measurement device, but this scheme was also fraught with problems and proved extremely hard to implement in the launch environment. Another weakness observed was the lack of continuing support. In this case, designers were involved in several projects and had limited resources available to assist after the system had been turned over to the end user. This problem could have been avoided by using a COTS system."
4/22/2010,2736,Exploration Systems,"The Space Shuttle Orbiter rejects heat from onboard electrical equipment, crew members, and other sources to an independent ground refrigerant loop through an onboard heat exchanger. Ground-provided umbilicals that separate from the spacecraft at launch provide primary loop single-phase coolant to the onboard heat exchanger from the circulation unit located at the base of the launch pad. The collected heat is in turn rejected from this primary coolant loop to a secondary two-phase refrigerant system. This method of heat rejection proved to be unreliable and difficult to control for the ground cooling system operator because the spacecraft heat loads varied. A much more stable, reliable system was put in place when a third intermediate loop was implemented into the ground cooling system with a heating element that allowed the refrigerant loop to operate at a constant set point.",FALSE,"To reject varying spacecraft heat loads prior to launch, circulate a primary loop single-phase refrigerant through the spacecraft-to-ground heat exchanger while maintaining a constant heat load via a heater on a secondary ground loop to a tertiary two-phase refrigeration loop because that makes a more stable and reliable system for ground-cooling equipment than the previously used variable-load system. <br/>

As a result, Boeing designed a system consisting of two load-sensing pins: one pin for attaching the rotator to the OMS pod lifting fixture and the other for attaching the rotator to the facility attachment point. Each sensing pin is connected to a readout unit to indicate when the rotator is under load or when the rotator load changes between tension and compression. Two load-sensing pins are used for redundancy.",FALSE,"The rotator's screw shaft will bend if the rotator is overdriven. The rotator's screw shaft will also bend if the jack screws of the lifting-fixture pivot shaft are overdriven.

Less experienced operating personnel were not always able to make the right call."
4/20/2010,2976,Space Operations,"Due to the high-volume storage of gases at KSC, gas leaks have often gone undetected for long periods. This resulted in significant costs, especially when there have been leaks in the gaseous helium (GHe) system. To detect a leak suspected in a large interconnected system such as the GHe system, subsystems must be incrementally isolated to narrow the leak down to a particular area for more focused, detailed inspections. This entails significant time and effort and, because outages in real time are required, also adds to the processing time.  New designs or upgrades to the KSC pneumatic systems should incorporate a strategy for detection and quick isolation of gas leakages.",FALSE,"The event described above is only one recent example of several GHe leak events that have occurred over the duration of the Shuttle program. Some of the known leak incidences have cost as much as $200,000 for a single event.  Over the long term of a program, significant savings could be achieved by better detection of gas leakages. For inert gases such as GN2, system leak detection working in conjunction with O2 monitoring systems, could also aid in safety enhancements."

This test technique, the Helium Signature Test, is an end-to-end leak check of the entire MPS and serves as a final validation of flightworthiness. A test such as the Helium Signature Test can be used for any enclosed hazardous system with a control volume to ensure overall system integrity before the hazardous medium is introduced.",FALSE,"While point leak checks of individual threaded, flange, brazed, and welded joints are important validations of joint integrity for new and not-yet-validated joints, as well as good interval checks of the health of these components, they do not cover all possible sources of propellant leakage. Fatigue or wear during a previous flight or damage during ground processing could result in leakage from a component that was not leak-checked, or that was leak-checked before the damage occurred.

Other problems were noted, including time-consuming efforts in inventory control and reporting functions; mundane repetitive accountability procedures; the need for more stringent requirements for accuracy and quality control; and problems with configuration control and documentation control. <br/>

The lesson learned from this experience was that entering data by visual observation and handwritten entries produced numerous errors; but by bar-coding parts, a database can be built and used for easy processing of thousands of parts. Travelers can be printed with preloaded information from the database in lieu of making visual observations and hand entries. <br/>

Some advantages gained from bar coding and tracking were; 
  Reduced cost (fewer installation mistakes per configuration and fewer installation man-hours)   
   Improved accountability of hardware from removal through installation during processing (better logistic accountability and elimination of delays for configuration verification)    
  Improved installation of parts (for multiple items) by bar-coding the part and its location with the same bar code number  
  Improved efficiency _ rather than being retrieved from a random handwritten log, with the Parts To Go function, parts can be retrieved from a sorted list (arranged by vehicle zone, installation drawing, or any manner the technician might choose)    
   Reduced need for paperwork to correct configuration discrepancies (errors in entering, reading, or transcribing part/serial/order control numbers)

10/29/2009,2136,Exploration Systems,"The early work of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) focused on human factors engineering (i.e., applying what is known about human capabilities and limitations to the design of products, processes, systems, and work environments) as it related to human spaceflight, particularly crew health and performance. During the transition from the Orbital Space Plane Project (OSP) Program to the Constellation Program, the requirements for applying human factors engineering to the design of tasks related to the ground processing of space vehicles were not well-defined. Since that time, these 1-G (Earth gravity) human factors requirements have been defined at different levels of maturity depending upon whether they relate to flight hardware/software, ground support systems (GSS), or ground support equipment (GSE). Effectively, all of these areas are leveraging human factors engineering to optimize ground processing of flight hardware. <br/>
<br/>
This document includes lessons learned for incorporating human factors design considerations in the following areas: within the outer mold line of the flight hardware, at the ground systems-to-flight systems interface, and in the design of GSS and GSE leading up to the flight systems interface. The major focus is on current requirements and processes for applying human factors considerations in the design of GSS and GSE, taking into account that this involves a large program that does not list human factors engineering as a separate item in the work breakdown structure (WBS). The attached paper illustrates the importance of human factors engineering in the design of ground processing and launch operations for launch vehicles.",FALSE,"    Use available experiences and lessons from prior programs to optimize ground processing operability by leveraging human  capabilities, not exceeding them.     

Employ people qualified in human factors engineering on the team from the beginning of the project.       
Make human factors a proactive part of the design process with well-defined requirements that add value to the design.       
Voice the need for human factors accommodations where appropriate. Even if these comments are not accepted, the effort is worthwhile because it helps to develop a better awareness of the importance of human factors.     
 
In document reviews, look at previous successful human factors program documentation such as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lessons learned publications, and make comments to promote consideration of human factors.     
Try to incorporate human factors into the design proactively, reactively, and everywhere. When resources are limited (which is often the case when using human factors engineering in a particular engineering culture for the first time), apply them to the areas that will produce the best results. Also, build on past successes and combine the work done on multiple successful projects.     
Creating human factors requirements at a higher level is important in gaining acceptance of human factors requirements at lower levels.     
Future NASA programs should consider incorporating all Level 2 (L2) human factors requirements into one document such as CxP 70024, Constellation Program: Human-Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR), i.e., include the ground processing human factors requirements for ground hardware with the ground processing human factors requirements for flight hardware.     
Recommend that pilot testing of new processes be done as soon as possible, but make sure that the pilot test will produce added value.      
When processes already exist, try to modify them to incorporate the human factors design considerations.      
Exercise patience and be ready to compromise in gaining acceptance of new requirements.     
From the beginning, make sure existing documentation is understood. Work early to improve the existing documentation or obtain a buy-in from all parties that the human factors requirements document can supersede existing documentation.      
Because MIL-STD-1472 was used as a human factors standard in the past, it is hard to adopt a requirements document with less content, even though complying with the more than 1,700 requirements in MIL-STD-1472 would have been very difficult.     
Human factors engineers should perform the human factors assessment as embedded members of the design team.

<br/>The root causes and consequences of the incidents contained in this document vary drastically; however, certain themes can be deduced and utilized for future hypergolic propellant handling.   Some of those common themes are summarized below:
       Improper configuration control and complacency can lead to being falsely comfortable with a system    
  Communication breakdown can escalate an incident to a level where injuries occur and/or hardware is damaged    
  Improper propulsion system and ground support system designs can destine a system for failure

  Improper procedural oversight, development, and adherence to the procedure can be detrimental and quickly lead to an undesirable incident    
  Improper local cleanliness or compatibility can result in fires or explosions

If these items were properly addressed prior to the incidents, prevention may have been possible (in hindsight) or the ramifications of the incident could have been reduced.
  Improper configuration control and internal or external human performance shaping factors can lead to a false comfort level .   
<ol type=""i"">   Vent systems are often neglected and treated as non-hazardous even though they can capture and contain condensed hypergolic liquids (especially in low points) .  
  Aging support hardware should be routinely inspected to reduce the risk of a failure during critical operations.     
  Communication breakdown can escalate an incident to a level where injuries occur or hardware is damaged   
<ol type=""i"">   Communication protocols should be pre-coordinated prior to an operation      
  Improper propulsion system and ground support system designs can destine a system for failure   
<ol type=""i"">   Every effort should be made to design out low points in GSE   
   Unknown incompatibilities (from lack of training or research) with propellants can cause surprising failures      
   Improper training of technicians, engineers, and safety personnel can put lives in danger   
<ol type=""i"">   Inadequate knowledge of potential electrostatic discharge hazards while working fuel operations can lead to a fire or explosion   
   Knowledge of instrumentation error and/or offsets are very important for system oversight      
   Improper personal protective equipment, spill protection, and staging of fire extinguishing equipment can result in unnecessary injuries or hardware damage if an incident occurs

<ol type=""i"">   Improper emergency procedures can increase the risk of injuries or hardware damage      
   Improper local cleanliness or housekeeping (for example iron oxide or rust) can result in fires or explosions   
   A thorough hypergol system evacuation should be completed (wherever a vacuum is tolerable by the system) prior to the removal or disconnection of any hypergolic propellant fittings   
   A pulse purge using an inert gas has proven to be inadequate for residual propellant removal   
   Advance warning of an incident appears approximately 50% of the time (according to the data presented); therefore, personnel supporting a hypergol operation should be cognizant of any system fluctuations and be prepared to execute safing procedures if the need arises

5/5/2009,2050,Aeronautics Research,"Flight software development problems led NASA to study the factors that have led to the accelerating growth in flight software size and complexity. The March 2009 report on the NASA Study on Flight Software Complexity contains recommendations in the areas of systems engineering, software architecture, testing, and project management.",FALSE,"    Engineers and scientists often don't realize the downstream complexity (and cost) that result from their local decisions. Overly stringent requirements and simplistic hardware interfaces can complicate software; FSW descope decisions and ill-conceived autonomy can complicate operations; and inattention to testability can complicate verification efforts.
<br><br/>    Unsubstantiated requirements have caused unnecessary FSW complexity where the requirement was either unnecessary or overly stringent. Rationale statements have often been omitted or misused in spite of a best practice that calls for a rationale for every requirement. Reference (4) places great emphasis on the need to provide rationales.
<br><br/>    Although overall complexity can be reduced through engineering trade studies involving multiple stakeholders (e.g., flight, ground, hardware, software, testing, operations), Reference (3) found that trade studies were often omitted or performed superficially. 
<br><br/>    Good software architecture is the most important defense against incidental complexity in software designs, but good architecting skills are not common. 
<br><br/>    A decision is often made not to implement a FSW function, or not to fix a FSW defect, principally because an operational workaround is feasible. This practice transfers complexity from FSW to mission operations where it is a continuing cost rather than a one-time cost and where it increases the risk of an operational error. 
<br><br/>    Fault management (aka fault protection) software is among the most difficult FSW to specify, design, and test. Other fault management problems (Reference (5)) include inconsistent fault management terminology used by NASA centers and their contractors, mismatches between mission requirements and the fault management approach, and lack of attention to fault management in university curricula.
<br><br/>    Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software can provide valuable functionality, but it often comes with unneeded features that interact with other features and complicate testing. 
<br><br/>    Because software development can generate at least 1 defect per 10,000 LOC, FSW with 1 million LOC will have 100 defects, some of which will likely manifest during mission operations.  Mature software may contain latent defects that may manifest in new applications.

4/14/2009,2048,Science,"In-flight the EPOXI spacecraft exhibited a safe mode instability after a portion of the torque distribution was assigned to a reaction wheel that had been powered down. It was determined that safing assumes that all wheels are operational and does not check the power state of each wheel. It would not significantly increase flight software complexity for safing to check the status of each wheel. Safing designers should also consider avoiding reliance on a software flag to activate a set of RWAs, disabling auxiliary controllers while in safe mode, avoiding autonomous switching from thruster to RWA control, disabling unnecessary attitude control performance enhancement features while in safe mode, and scrutinizing new features that may have unintended consequences when added to heritage systems.",FALSE,"    A system that permits safe mode to ""use"" all four RWAs regardless of the power state of the wheels may minimize flight software complexity, but it may pose an elevated risk of unintended consequences. For EPOXI, it caused erroneous activation of auxiliary controllers.<br></br>    

The null-space and torque minimization controllers rely on a software flag for activation of a set of RWAs instead of directly interrogating each RWA on its operational state. The EPOXI anomaly demonstrated that such a flag can be inconsistent with the actual hardware available for attitude control.<br></br>    

Auxiliary controllers (e.g., the null-space and torque minimization controllers) enhance the attitude control performance of the spacecraft during nominal flight operations, but their operation is not essential to stable operation when the spacecraft is in safe mode. The controllers add a degree of unpredictability to the safing performance, and they complicate testing of the safing logic over the full range of failure scenarios.<br></br>    

During safe mode, the EPOXI flight software design mandates a transition from attitude control by thrusters back to attitude control by RWAs without review by ground controllers. This feature may have been inherited from missions that have less propellant mass margin and seek to speed the transition from thruster control to conserve propellant and maximize satellite lifespan. However, autonomous transition to wheel control introduces a plethora of possible failure modes.<br></br>    

The EPOXI flight software was derived from a heritage system that (1) lacked the capability to track the RWA hardware set that was actually active and (2) would power down a wheel in fewer fault conditions. The EPOXI FP authority to power down a wheel thus represented a new capability, and a more thorough scrub of the flight system heritage logic (defining when to use the auxiliary controllers) might have exposed the attendant risks.

11/20/2008,1976,Aeronautics Research,"Between February 1998 and March 2005, NASA conducted a study called National Aeronautics Operational Monitoring System, also known as NAOMS.  NAOMS is a survey-based data collection system designed to collect aviation safety data from general aviation and air carrier pilots. NAOMS was designed to quantify aviation safety events and other safety-relevant phenomena. Because incidents posing a threat to aviation safety are relatively rare events, useful analysis requires the acquisition of a large, statistically meaningful database that is representative of the system.  These data can be used to identify system-wide trends and establish performance measures with emphasis on tracking the effects of safety interventions (new procedures, technologies, and training) on national aviation safety levels.  The NAOMS project selected a contractor to develop a survey methodology to acquire such data.
<br/>
<br/>It was recognized that the type of data that was sought (information on incidents, infractions, and mistakes potentially affecting aviation safety), carries with it the potential for significant risk for the person reporting such information.  Prior to interviewing pilots for the NAOMS survey, NASA promised that the pilots who were willing to participate in the survey could be assured that their identity would be protected.  The survey-based project team offered anonymity to those taking part in the survey, and one of the contractors responsibilities was to anonymize the data set.  
<br/>
<br/>Data collection using the methodology began in April 2001 and ended in December 2004, during which time the project team conducted approximately 24,000 surveys of commercial airline pilots and approximately 5,000 general aviation pilots.   Research conducted in the NAOMS project, including the survey methodology, had not been peer-reviewed and should not be viewed or considered as having been validated.
<br/>",FALSE,"Most statistical agencies (e.g. Census Bureau) are governed by the Confidentiality Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA) of 2002 when releasing confidential information is at issue. CIPSEA requires all federal agencies to protect data or information acquired by the agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes from being disclosed in identifiable form. The NASA Office of the General Counsel determined that CIPSEA does not apply to the NAOMS information collection.  For purposes of CIPSEA, NASA is considered a non-statistical agency.  As a non-statistical agency, the information collection must be conducted by civil servants to have CIPSEA apply.  During the NAOMS project, contractors collected survey information.  Also, in order to have CIPSEA protection, there is a specific &quot;confidentiality pledge&quot; that comes directly from the statute.  This pledge was not read to the NAOMS participants. The bottom-line is that CIPSEA does not apply to NAOMS. Also, allowing another statistical agency, who has CIPSEA coverage, to archive and distribute the raw data to qualified identities, will not further protect the NAOMS data.
<br/>
<br/>The very best approach to an aviation survey and data base project would be to have it conducted by a statistical agency of the US Government. This would also allow the establishment of a Research Data Center under the strict control of the statistical agency. Under such rules, even the raw survey data could be used by researchers without any redaction. The research would have to be performed by the researchers in Washington DC, on the premises of the statistical agency and under their rules, constraints, and supervision.  No expensive redaction project would be needed and confidentiality could be assured. 
<br/>
<br/>The concept of a Research Data Center is a means to secure facilities designed for outside researchers to access confidential agency data. Several statistical federal agencies (e.g. Census Bureau) have instituted the concept of a Research Data Center with much success.  Access to the NAOMS raw survey responses would be under defined criteria and confidentiality conditions.  The Research Data Center could be established within NASA or through sponsorship from a statistical agency already equipped with the infrastructure to share, control, and monitor the use of confidential survey responses. 
<br/>
<br/>Under the concept of a Research Data Center, an interested party would submit a request or proposal to NASA for the use of NAOMS raw survey responses. The proposal would be evaluated for merit, NASA mission related interests, and the requesters ability to maintain confidentiality. Upon acceptance of the proposal, the requester would agree to the terms of use of the raw survey responses, including the confidentiality requirements.  Any products created with, or from, the use of the raw survey responses would be provided to NASA before its publication and release. The Research Data Center provides the framework to allow individuals or organizations with proven capabilities to analyze the NAOMS survey responses with minimal cost to NASA.

7/10/2007,1799,Science,"The loss of the IMAGE satellite was attributed to a Single Event Upset-induced ""instant trip"" of the Solid State Power Controller (SSPC) that supplies power to the single-string Transponder. The circuit breaker was not reset because this hybrid device incorrectly reported the circuit breaker as closed, and ground could not command a reset because the satellite's single telemetry receiver had been disabled by the SSPC. The SSPC's problematic state reporting characteristic was an intentional design feature that was not reflected in any part documentation, and three similar ""instant trips"" on other NASA satellites had not been reported in the GIDEP system. Consider hardwiring receiver power to the power bus, or build redundancy into the power switching or into the operational status sensing. Ensure that GIDEP reports or NASA Alerts are written and routed to mission operations (as well as to hardware developers), and that flight software responds to command loss with a set of timed spacecraft-level fault responses.",TRUE,"  



  The ability to switch a transponder on and off, especially when a smart device replaces a fused supply, provides flexibility during spacecraft integration and test, and facilitates a mission design in which the transponder is OFF during ascent. However, the IMAGE mishap may validate the typical industry-wide practice of minimizing the risk of losing uplink telemetry by hardwiring the receiver to the power bus.
<br><br>  

  Overcurrent protection of a spacecraft receiver may actually pose a mission-critical risk unless the protection device is designed to reset (in a robust and redundant manner) after transient faults in either the receiver or the overcurrent protection device itself.
<br><br>  

  Had the IMAGE PDU EDAC designers known in advance about the SSPC's status reporting limitation, they could have designed the logic to prevent an unrecoverable loss of receiver power. For example, it could have imposed a transponder voltage test that closed the SSPC after an extended voltage drop. Also, NASA part anomaly alerts are typically distributed only to hardware developers; distribution to operations personnel would allow early consideration of possible mitigation action.
<br><br>
  

  
Protection against the loss of ground commanding was needed at the flight system level. A system-level command loss fault response from the flight software in IMAGE's main computer that reached to the root level (i.e., including the SSPC) would have reset the telecom power supply SSPC as well as reasserting attitude control and other subsystem and system functions. ""Command loss fault protection"" typically resets its timer periodically over the course of normal operations; after the flight software loses ground commanding (for whatever reason), the fault protection will (after a period of days or months) cycle through different system configurations and options until contact is restored.

  	A non-essential fuse blown during a test pyrotechnic firing only two months before MER launch produced an unexpected circuit condition.

One month of intensive circuit analysis by a group of very senior engineers proved that MER could safely launch.<br><br>  
  	Only 48 hours before the MER landing, an analysis of testbed data suggested an apparent timing problem with the pyrotechnic system electronics that trigger the landing events.

During the process of machining a piece of mission critical hardware, a metal lathe was shut down so that a new filter system could be installed. Coolant was emptied from the lathe and replaced with a cleaning solution. After the operator on the next shift began work on the part, he noticed that the appearance of the fluid was different and shut down the equipment. Cleaning solution contains acids that can permanently damage hardware. The hardware was inspected for damage, and a lock and tag-out procedure was instituted to prevent a future incident.

4/28/2006,1759,Exploration Systems,"A video clip lesson learned on the topic of Process Control. A èsqueegee,è a wafer-thin wedge of plastic, is used on the Space Shuttle Solid Rockets to apply the adhesive that bonds critical insulation to the inside of the motor case. Silicone is widely used throughout industry as a release agent. In this use, it cannot be allowed to contaminate adhesive application toolsè even in trace amounts. Its introduction into the adhesive application process can weaken bonds and allow hot gases to force a path between the insulation and the metal case. The supplier delivered squeegees that tested positive for trace amounts of silicone despite clear specifications prohibiting it. The supplier believed it had met this requirement because no silicone was used in the material used to form the squeegee. However, an investigation determined that the supplier had used a silicone-based release agent to ease squeegee removal from the manufacturing molds. If the supplier had known the reason for the no-silicone specification, they would have understood the mission-critical implications of silicone contamination on Space Shuttle components. Clear communications between customers and suppliers is critical to maintaining process control.

4/28/2006,1760,Exploration Systems,"A video clip lesson learned on the topic of Process Control. Actuators inside the tail enable the rudder speed brake panels to steer and slow the Space Shuttle during descent and landing. Unusual wear was found on the planet gears of the actuators during an inspection. This led to a discovery that when the Shuttle was built the gears were installed incorrectlyè a critical flight failure mode. The installation error stemmed from the near identical appearance of component gears that had different design topographies. The robust actuators were able to operate for 20 years (approximately 30 missions) without failure. The mistake was not found sooner because the actuators were certified for the original flight life of the Shuttleè 10 years or 100 missions. New gears were installed, and a process control was implemented that accommodates the demands of ground operations. A dedicated fixture was fabricated for each actuator with physical features that prevent installation of the incorrect gear. Designs should be mistake-proofed so that components cannot be assembled incorrectly.

10/26/2005,5776,Science,"The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) routinely partners with International organizations building spacecraft or instruments for launching on foreign vehicles or vice versa. GSFC built an X-ray Spectrometer (XRS) which was incorporated into a Japanese spacecraft, Astro E-2, which was launched on a Japanese vehicle. Astro E-2 was actually the repeat of the failed Astro E mission in which the launch vehicle failed to make orbit. Interestingly, Astro E was deemed a success even though XRS was never operated on orbit and was the rationale behind adopting a –build to print” approach for Astro E-2. That is, use the same drawings and design approach as the original Astro E build with little or no changes. Astro E-2 made it to orbit and was renamed Suzaku as is Japanese custom. Unfortunately both Astro E and Astro E-2 had the same flaw which failed the Astro E-2 and would have failed Astro E had its launch been successful. The fatal design flaw that originated in the Astro E spacecraft was propagated to the Astro E-2 spacecraft was found to be the single proximate cause for this mishap but the underlying root causes are complex and intertwined which were enabled by the nature of the unsound approach to the inter- organizational collaborative effort.",FALSE,"From the Astro E-2 MIB: NASA and ISAS did not develop a common approach to project management, joint mission level reviews with shared understanding of those reviews, configuration management, interface control documents, systems integration, and project management standards. The Suzaku team failed to create a mission-level review process that allowed the full participation of both partners, partly due to language and cultural barriers (as is Japanese tradition missions are renamed upon launch). Design reviews were primarily conducted in Japanese; GSFC had no in-plant representative; the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA) were not implemented; and of the seven ICDs generated only two were approved and the approval signatories were all GSFC personnel, Japanese concurrence was never documented. The board also believed that the –build to print” approach compromised the collaborations, as well as the design review process for Astro E-2. The reviews were neither thorough nor incisive, perhaps due to the assumed success of Astro E. When the absence of some required approved ICDs was noted during the investigation, the Critical Design Review (CDR) chair replied, ”There is no need for ICDs, itês already built?” Thus, GSFC did not have sufficient interaction with the ISAS partner in the areas of project management and system engineering at the mission and integrated instrument levels. Specifically,

  No GSFC XRS instrument manager or system engineer was appointed. GSFC was, in reality, in charge of only the helium insert portion of XRS and supporting electronics, and not the entire instrument.    

     Mission-level reviews were conducted in Japanese, with the exception of GSFC-specific portions. The Institute of Space and Astronautical  Science (ISAS) Critical Design Review had no NASA participants and the JAXA/ISAS major reliability review (called Soutenken) had no NASA participation.  

     No joint systems, subsystem, test, or operations engineering working groups were put in place.  
     NASA was not involved in mission-level Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA).    </ul>

ISAS and GSFC did not adequately plan and rehearse mission operations. Specifically,    The Suzaku team departed from normal practices in that mission-critical operationsãfor example, the irreversible opening of the He and Ne vents and valve V12), and the (planned) opening of the aperture gate valveãwere performed for the first time in flight with little rehearsal or analysis.       The Board could find no evidence that the ISAS/GSFC team conducted any operations contingency planning.   </ul>

When planning any mission a cohesive, coherent, and effective approach should be implemented and communicated to all of the parties involved. Organizational responsibilities and interfaces need to be defined and maintained throughout the projectês life cycle. This is particularly true for International missions where there are inherent geographic, cultural and communication barriers and ITAR requirements that must be overcome.

The need for PQV may be overlooked in plans and contracts because hardware featuring RTDs may be mistakenly considered to be purely mechanical assemblies. Also, a problem with qualifying a single standard mounting configuration is the lack of analytical insight into what changes may invalidate the flight qualification."

8/8/2005,1619,Aeronautics Research," An integration and test failure was traced to an unmated flight connector that was registered as &ldquo;mated&rdquo; in the mate/demate log.  The root cause was attributed to the failure of a technician/engineer to pause after each mate/ demate operation to enter it in the log, and to obtain QA verification.  Flight connectors located in crowded or constrained areas (as well as those in more visible areas) must be mated or demated one-at-a-time under QA supervision, and accurate documentation of the connector status must be maintained.

6/30/2005,1626,Aeronautics Research," On the afternoon of June 17, 2004, there was a request to implement an approved Configuration Change Request to increase the left wing-fuselage clearance of the X-43A research vehicle.  To accomplish this required some trimming to the left wing leading edge.  In order to perform this modification, the avionics technician positioned the left wing leading edge up by halting an incomplete ground Built-in-Test (BIT) that allowed access for the work.  Power was removed from the vehicle to allow the work to be performed safely. Contractors then completed the modification to the wing.  The technician restored power to the vehicle and attempted to lower the wing by repeating the surface BIT.  The rudder swept into the (still raised) wing causing minor structural damage to the rudder and the wing as the surfaces impacted.  The BIT was stopped and power to the vehicle was removed.  
     ",TRUE," Develop and follow procedures for non-standard operations of the BIT.

6/27/2005,1598,Aeronautics Research," After two and one-half years of operational use, a bearing cage instability trend developed in a bearing in one of three Cassini reaction wheels.  JPL responded to the indication of life-limiting wear through steps to manage RWA use, including tracking RWA performance, limiting RWA usage, using a software tool to manage reaction wheel biasing events, and providing a reaction wheel drag torque estimator to identify anomalous bearing drag conditions.  
     ",TRUE," As complex mechanisms critical to spacecraft operations, reaction wheels should be treated as a limited resource, even when there is no indication of anomalous performance or life-limiting wear.

6/23/2005,1624,Aeronautics Research," Pratt and Whitney F100-PW-229 engines were not preserved and caused cost and schedule impacts to the project.  
      
      
     ",TRUE," Ensure that engines follow manufacturer's recommendations for storage or document how the engines are going to be preserved if it deviates from manufacturers recommendations.  
     "
6/23/2005,1625,Aeronautics Research," Problems were experience bringing NASA F-15 837 back to flight status after not flying for over 18 months.  The problems resulted in cost and schedule slips that could have been prevented if a plan was established to operate some of the components at specified time intervals.  The time and expense to perform this type of maintenance is necessary in order to effectively preserve Dryden's aging fleet of aircraft.  
     ",TRUE," Ensure that an aircraft that is in flyable storage or in an extended down time has a plan in place to operate as many of the systems as possible within a given time period.  
     "
6/7/2005,1565,Aeronautics Research," The Agency has aggressively committed to pursue performance tracking such as Earned Value Management (EVM).  However, given the constraints of operating within the restrictions and limitations of a government agency, EVM can be very difficult and in some situations impossible to attain.  The Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) Project made a serious attempt to implement EVM and both ATMSDI contractors reported monthly EVM status to the AATT Project Office.  Additionally, the Project Office hired an EVM subject matter expert and attempted to track EVM utilizing in-house civil service labor plans and acturals.  This was prior to implementation of an Agency-wide generic full cost accounting system.  The AATT effort proved to be labor intensive and would have required creation of over 100 individual job order (account) numbers in the Ames financial system alone in order to accurately capture and track individual task level work plans and actuals.  In fact, Ames' financial management organization did not react favorably to the prospect of so many cost accounts for a number of reasons (additional workload being one).  Without the necessary level of detail in collecting planned and actual expenses, Earned Value Management effectiveness becomes severely compromised.  The AATT Project found that the level of information gained did not justify the workload placed on the task leads and/or PIs or the AATT Systems Management Staff.  
      
    The overall lesson learned is that if Earned Value is to be effective, Center and Agency foundations in terms of accounting systems, resources (both financial and human), tools, and cultures need to be supportive and made fully available.  
      
     ",FALSE,"(Specific lessons from the AATT Project's attempt at EVM)  
  
1. Within the Control of the Project:  
  a. Project formulation needs to start with a detailed project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to identify the work packages to be tracked.  
  b. The WBS must be developed with as much detail as possible.  It should not be constrained from the beginning based on the level of tracking capability or other accounting system restrictions.  
  c. The level of tracking can be than the level of planning detail, not vice versa.  
  d. Progress needs to be measured at levels low enough to provide accurate information, yet this may be at levels lower than currently planned.  
  e. Activities, objectives, exit criteria, deliverables and performance measures need to be identified early and documented with as much detail as possible.  One cannot measure progress if one does not know what they are trying to achieve.  
  f. Each work package to be tracked must have a separate funding cost account to enable the Actual Cost of Work Planned (ACWP) earned value metric to be calculated.  
  g. Quantifiable, objective measures of work package progress are often better than subjective estimates of percent complete, yet they cost more to identify and regularly measure.  
  
2. Outside the Controls of the Project:  
  a. Project managers need to be provided with reliable labor and overhead rates for each civil servant employee working on the project in order to accurately capture civil servant costs.  
  b. A projectès earned value system should not have to account for or be held accountable for, organizational taxes or Center taxes, which do not directly contribute to the satisfaction of project objectives.  
  c. Performing organizations must task both their in-house and out-of-house contractors within the work package structure such that the contractor expenditures can be tracked to specific guidelines as they work.  
  d. Frequency of re-base lining the plans is dependent upon outside influences such as availability and stability of resources provided versus planned.  Congressional budget cuts, earmarks, etc. will force re-base lining.  
  e. Frequency of re-base lining may be dependent upon having stable requirements, many of which may be provided from outside the project.  For example, the AATT Project supports requirements of the FAA.  The FAA often changes these requirements, which then impact the AATT Project plans."
6/7/2005,1568,Aeronautics Research," Key subordinate project management positions must be truly accountable to the Project Manager. Sub-project managers must be empowered to manage and make decisions pertaining to their element of the project. Roles, responsibilities and authority of SP managers should be agreed to by line and project management and formally documented up front. The sub-project managers should be recognized as having the appropriate management authority necessary to make key decisions in both the direction of the work and the funding required to accomplish it. The AATT Project is perspective is that ideally such key positions as sub-project managers should report directly to the project manager. Any agreements and arrangements for matrix organizational support must be carefully thought out, documented and communicated to all involved organizations including management (all levels) and those responsible to do the work. Special attention should be given to assure this support is indeed provided through the life of the project and that continuity is maintained when personnel inevitably turnover. AATT experienced a significant amount of key position turnovers and in some instances new managers reinvented the wheel which has an effect on all support staff impacting overall effectiveness and efficiency.  
     ",TRUE," Without proper authority and accountability to appropriate line management, the efficiency and effectiveness of individual subordinate support managers is significantly diminished. This can have a detrimental and even disruptive effect both on day-to-day work and ability to achieve successful project milestones and deliverables on time and on schedule.  
     "
6/7/2005,1566,Aeronautics Research," Most all projects in today's environment invariably require the cooperation and support of multiple organizations both in development and acceptance of project deliverables (including multiple government agencies, the project's customers, educational institutions and potential industry stakeholders and users).  With resources scarce at all levels and close oversight and scrutiny (both internally and externally), the importance of the inevitable matrix organizations established to carry out programs and projects from formulation through implementation cannot be overemphasized.  
      
    The Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) Project made a significant effort in communicating and developing agreements with key partners such as the FAA, as a primary receiver/user of the Project's products.  A multitude of Memorandum of Understanding/Agreements, etc., were established and utilized during the life of this project.  Clearly, the partnership with the FAA proved to be the Project's greatest challenge.  
      
    With continuous management and organizational changes at all levels, policy and procedure changes, etc., AATT experienced problems, as grouped and summarized below:  
      
    A. Interacting with, and learning to work with an entirely different federal agency such as the FAA: It took much time and resources to experience and understand key cultural and organizational differences involving everything from policy, procedures, politics, and communication processes in both technical and administrative/management domains.  Comments at all levels across the AATT Project demonstrate that this was one of the most significant ongoing challenges.  The FAA failed for a number of reasons to provide consistent single points of contact (POC) for any appreciable length of time.  One manager reports that the average life of an FAA POC has been less than 2 years.  Also, unexpected union issues and concerns ensued with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), which were increased since AATT had a presence at more than one FAA facility.  To further complicate things, continual shifts and/or reorganizations within the FAA resulted in AATT technology being moved from organization to organization constantly requiring NASA managers and researchers to educate and establish relationships with new FAA personnel.  
      
    B. Resource Support: As the AATT Project matured, FAA commitments to provide joint support funding, personnel and/or facilities declined for a number of reasons.  AATT learned the high risk this really is from the start and how it can lead to de-scoping, schedule delays or tradeoffs not originally foreseen.  
      
    C. Technical Transfer of Project Products: AATT invested much time and energy in working with a number of FAA POCs at various levels to establish an agreed upon process and understanding of technologies to be passed on for further development and implementation into the National Airspace System (NAS).  The FAA has stated that they are often unprepared for the research NASA develops that they are then expected to further develop and implement into the operational environment.  The AATT tailored TRL (Technology Readiness Level) process has been used for these purposes. An ongoing problem AATT has experienced is the FAA's desire and need to know how a newly developed NASA technology being handed over, will fit into the evolving NAS.  
      
    D. External Agreements and Management Support: As indicated above, the AATT Project was subjected to much instability and organizational dynamics in its relationship to the FAA.  Formal agreements that were made and in place between the FAA and the AATT Project regarding technologies to be prototyped, demonstrated, and transferred in support of stakeholder requirements were ignored.  In light of this, it is crucial to gain long-term top-level management support from any and all key participating organizations including necessary resource commitments.  
      
     ",TRUE," For all of the above listed examples, the importance of establishing strong up-front relationships and communications between all levels of management authority down to working collaborations cannot be overemphasized.  This is especially important when two large federal agencies are involved that must work successfully together to research and develop complex technical concepts and tools that must be passed from one to the other for implementation into the operational systems of the real world.  
     "
6/7/2005,1571,Aeronautics Research," Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) was a nine-year effort and experienced significant changes in documentation requirements from Headquarters and the lead center.  This had an effect on the policies, procedures, formats, and content for project planning and formulation documents including the program, project and sub-project plans (or IBPDs), along with related other agreements and supportive plans (e.g. Program Commitment Agreements, Risk Management/Mitigation Plans, Tech Transfer Plans, etc.).  Examples include everything from title and formatting changes to basic content requirements including the program and project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  
      
    The WBS continues to be a key tool that is recognized as being one of the most important basic building blocks around which a program and project(s) should be developed.  Its potential for being the central structure, providing the basis for successful financial and Earned Value management and control, along with project metrics, technical and performance tracking, and schedule development cannot be denied.  AATT experienced confusing and sometimes unclear guidance regarding the best way to develop a WBS for projects focused on concept exploration and development and demonstration.  Both NASA and the private sector training provide theory and emphasize the key role and importance of a good WBS, but do not provide hands-on real world applications and assistance in creating a WBS for these types of projects.  The various types of WBS formats and approaches are offered (e.g., organizational versus product versus work, etc.), but clear guidance as to real world applications for the best approach and how to do it, within the constraints and limitations of the NASA financial management system and full cost accounting, is lacking.  
      
     ",TRUE," Much time and resources are wasted when disruptive top-level requirements are passed down without clear guidance as to what is really required that will satisfy future reviews and decision gates.  When this guidance is continually changed due to changes in managers who set them, it adds to the waste of time and resources.  
     "
6/5/2005,1569,Aeronautics Research," The AATT Project was directed, at the Non-Advocate Review (NAR), to not maintain a reserve, which significantly hampered the project's ability to mitigate risk and address unforeseen situations. Most schools-of-thought recognize the importance of any project manager maintaining a reasonable reserve for purposes of risk management and mitigation. Having no other option but to re/de-scope in some fashion obviously has negative effects on the project and its ability to deliver completely and on time.  
     ",FALSE," The lesson learned from the AATT Project is to ensure projects are authorized to maintain a funding reserve and this is honored and maintained throughout the life of the project. Often time project reserves are really not what they appear and are not made available to individual project managers granted necessary authority to make and implement decisions regarding their expenditure.  
     "
6/5/2005,1622,Aeronautics Research," On December 3, 2002 a &ldquo;close call&rdquo; involving a B52B aircraft, NASA 008, occurred as it was under going pre-flight for a mission the following day.  During the preflight, a gaseous nitrogen servicing hose was pressurized to approximately 5200 psi without the servicing end connected to the aircraft.  The hose end rose up and struck the aircraft numerous times, puncturing the upper surface of the right flap in two places.  The flow valve was shut off when the hose became lodged under a servicing cart tire.  No one was injured.  
     ",TRUE,"  
        All high-pressure hoses must be connected before pressurizing.  

        All high-pressure hoses must be restrained with either safety lanyards or sandbags prior to pressurizing.  

        When stored, all high-pressure hoses should have high-pressure caps installed.  
      "
6/5/2005,1574,Aeronautics Research," A number of times, the AATT Project was directed to add, delete, and/or change the project focus of research, not only on existing agreed-to ATM products (tools and concepts), but in some cases, change of direction to develop totally new tools. It is understood that flexibility in research must be maintained in order that concepts that do not prove worthwhile can be dropped allowing for focus and priority shifts to more promising ones. However, both realistic and reasonable controls on project scope and priority setting must be maintained to assure prudent management planning and decision-making. Excessive control and redirection of focus/priorities late into a project's life leads to wasteful use of resources and hampers the project's ability to manage and deliver effectively. Significant changes well into the implementation phase can be very costly as contractual planning and funds obligations limit the scope and/or task requirement changes that can bemade after the fact.  
      
    Directly related to the above is what we refer to as milestone creep. Project management shifts, along with changing (sometimes mandated) project priorities, resulted in too many milestones that grew in number all the way into the last trimester of the project. This also made it difficult to adhere to a uniform, consistent milestone organization and management system, resulting in some sub-projects with many more milestones and resultant work than others and the milestones becoming somewhat jumbled and not following the most logical sequencing. This caused a significant amount of work to support programmatic/administrative management, documentation and configuration control, tracking, etc. across organizations (including 3 centers and multiple directorates and divisions).  
      
     ",FALSE," It is easy to lose sight of the big picture and overall historical evolution with continual guidance to change direction/focus and/or project deliverables and related milestones. A strong Systems Management function will go a long was to maintain this perspective and advise management accordingly.

6/2/2005,1617,Aeronautics Research,"The Pegasus actuator system was redesigned to accommodate the need for greater hinge torque. The decision to re-utilize, as much as possible, of the existing legacy actuator drive system is not necessarily a poor choice. However, one must understand that significantly increasing the performance requirements will stress all components in the (sub)system.  Instantaneous currents associated with digital switching of power components can far exceed the steady-state values.  When considering undertaking a significant redesign of a system or sub-system, extreme care must be taken to ensure that reutilization of existing components, i.e. motherboards, power supplies, cabling, etc., doesn't pose a greater risk than the initial cost and schedule impact of a complete (sub)system redesign.",FALSE," Instantaneous currents associated with digital switching of power components can far exceed the steady-state values.

    Multiple failures during qualification testing, and the subsequent technical investigations, proved the lack of understanding between the ideal circuit operation and the impact of system implementation.  Low-inductance ground and power planes/paths within (sub)systems are essential for proper operation.  
      
     ",TRUE," Adequate spares must be carefully considered, especially when undertaking significant modifications to an existing design.

     ",FALSE," It was found that a combination of noise, back-feeding through the outputs of a logic device, and ground bounce were able to produce sufficient voltage below the components' manufacturer specified limit of -0.5 volts that resulted in the FET-based device &ldquo;latch-up&rdquo;. The outputs then went into a tri-state condition, allowing the output voltage to gradually rise to the rail voltage. This produced a destructive condition for the H-bridge output transistors. Also, the component manufacturer determined that once the logic device was exposed to this &ldquo;latch-up&rdquo; condition, it became more susceptible to future latch-ups  
     "
6/2/2005,1601,Aeronautics Research," During an approved test procedure, an additional effort was undertaken in the hopes of saving time, and expediting a modification. This modification was not approved as part of the test configuration. Not fully understanding the sequence of the test routine, the wing and rudder came into contact resulting in minor to moderate damage to both. Though an engineering solution prevented the need to replace the rudder, the schedule impact was not trivial while determining the extent of the damage and adequacy of the solution.

5/19/2005,1600,Aeronautics Research," Mr. Chuck Dorney, P.E., C.S.P. Chief, HQ AFMC/SES and SSEA Team Chief came out on April 19th, 2005 to accomplish the X-45A J-UCAS Hot Refueling System Safety Engineering Analysis (SSEA) for the USAF. During his initial in brief he made a very refreshing statement, &ldquo; that he wasn't here to approve, disapprove or inspect, he was here to help us accomplish this process safe and right.&rdquo; After the successful completion of the System Safety Engineering Analysis for the X-45A hot refueling he stated they (USAF) would revise T.O. 00-25-172 to list approval of X-45A hot refueling. Until the T.O. is revised, he advised the team that e-mail from his office would provide the authority to conduct x-45A hot refueling operations effective immediately.  
      
      
      
     ",FALSE," Even though this System Safety Engineering Analysis was required by the Air Force T.O., bringing in an expert to have an unbiased look at a new process or procedure especially a person with such a great attitude to get the job accomplished safely and correctly has it's merits. Boeing, NASA, and USAF reviewed the written procedures for the X-45A hot refueling. Mr. Dorney noticed that a standard USAF requirement for the verification of the refueling nozzle being positively locked onto the aircraft receptacle was over-looked. The verification of positive lock is accomplished by attaching the refuel nozzle to the aircraft receptacle, flipping up the locking handle, and then trying to remove the nozzle, if the nozzle handle rotates open past the locking handle you have a bad refuel nozzle and it shouldn't be used.

4/29/2005,1534,Aeronautics Research," The Dryden Aerospike Rocket Test Director's Discretionary Fund (DDF) project conducted flight research of an aerospike rocket nozzle design using high power amateur rockets. The standard nozzles in these rockets were replaced by the aerospike nozzles and the rockets are then flown with aerospike nozzles only. Two aerospike rockets were flown successfully to altitudes of over 26,000 ft and speeds of over Mach 1.5. The flight data acquired during the flight tests were stored onboard and retrieved after the rockets were recovered. The rockets were recovered using a dual-stage parachute system. The smaller drogue chute comes out at rocket apogee to stabilize the rocket. The main chute deploys at approximately 2500 ft above ground level to slow the rocket descend for a soft impact on landing. During the first rocket launch, the main chute deployed inadvertently when the drogue chute activated, and the rocket descended on the main chute from apogee. During the second rocket launch,
    the main chute bag got outside of the rocket airframe and was entangled with the main chute retention line, preventing main chute deployment and causing the rocket to descend under drogue chute only. Both of these problems were caused by excessive slack in the main parachute retaining line. ",FALSE, Excessive slack in the main chute retention line can cause inadvertent main chute deployment or main chute bag entanglement. 
4/29/2005,1621,Aeronautics Research," The Dryden Aerospike Rocket Test Director's Discretionary Fund (DDF) project conducted flight research of an aerospike rocket nozzle design using high power amateur rockets.

Two aerospike rockets were flown successfully to altitudes of over 26,000 ft and speeds of over Mach 1.5.  The flight data acquired during the flight tests were stored onboard and retrieved after the rockets were recovered.  The rocket chamber pressure was one of the mission-critical onboard measurements.  During the first rocket launch, hot rocket exhaust gas was allowed to impinge directly inside the rocket chamber pressure transducer sensing port.  Even though the pressure transducer was designed to survive hostile environments and remained operational, the high gas temperature caused it to produce pressure readings that were erroneously high for the firt two seconds of rocket motor firing.  During the second launch, silicon vacuum grease was used to pack the pressure port.  This shielded the pressure sensing port from the hot gas impingement, and good rocket chamber pressure measurements were obtained.  
      
      
     ",TRUE," Direct impingement of hot rocket exhaust gas can cause a pressure transducer to produce erroneous measurements temporarily.

Two aerospike rockets were flown successfully to altitudes of over 26,000 ft and speeds of over Mach 1.5. To determine the incoming flight flow angles, a simple flush air data system (FADS) was used.  The FADS system consists of four nosecone static pressure taps around the 10-degree rocket nosecone, clocked at 90 degrees apart.  One of the static pressure ports, port 3, is in an area where there is a slight waviness on the nosecone surface finish, on the order of 0.005 in.  As the results, port 3 static pressure measurements were consistently lower than the other three ports.  Uncorrected, this resulted in an extra 1 degree of apparent flow angle at transonic speeds.  
     ",TRUE," Surface waviness at the FADS pressure port location will change the local wall static pressure, resulting in additional apparent flow angles at transonic speeds.

4/29/2005,1533,Aeronautics Research," The Dryden Aerospike Rocket Test Director's Discretionary Fund (DDF) project conducted flight research of an aerospike rocket nozzle design using high power amateur rockets. The standard nozzles in these rockets were replaced by the aerospike nozzles and the rockets are then flown with aerospike nozzles only. Two aerospike rockets were flown successfully to altitudes of over 26,000 ft and speeds of over Mach 1.5. The flight data acquired during the flight tests were stored onboard and retrieved after the rockets were recovered. To help locate the rockets after they landed and homing radio beacon transmitters were installed on the recovery parachute harness. Two homing radio beacon transmitters were used. They were made by different manufacturers and operated on two different frequencies. An antenna broke from one of the transmitters, causing it to stop transmitting. The rocket was found using the radio signal from the remaining operative transmitter. ",FALSE, Homing radio beacon transmitters can lose their antennae and stop transmitting

        Because the JPL ERD (or other Centers' equivalent documentation) is the primary source of flight system environmental parameters, and the derived specifications for test levels and durations, there should be no ambiguity between the various project life-cycle environments defined in the ERD.

4/20/2005,1597,Aeronautics Research," A Navy E-2C Hawkeye aircraft was in the NASA Dryden Flight Loads Laboratory (FLL) for a series of wing and tail loads calibration tests.  A Close Call incident occurred in the FLL on December 13, 2004, when an &ldquo;H&rdquo;-Beam structure unexpectedly leaned outward and made contact with the top of the wing when structure was being removed from the right wing of the Navy E-2C Hawkeye aircraft.  The &ldquo;H&rdquo;-Beam structure had been used to keep the wing from deflecting upward and the aircraft from &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; while the under-wing load pads were being bonded to the aircraft.  
      
    The contact occurred four feet inboard of the wingtip directly above the wing's main spar.  Damage consisted of scraped paint over an area approximately 1.5&rdquo; by 2&rdquo; and two small scratches.  The damage was deemed &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; by the on-site Navy Representative.  
      
    It was determined that the primary factor for this incident was the overhead crane operator's misjudgment on the amount of tension that was applied to the two nylon safety straps that were utilized to support the &ldquo;H&rdquo;-Beam structure when restraining cables were disconnected.  The slack in the &ldquo;choker&rdquo; loops was enough to allow the structure to lean outboard approximately 15&deg;.  Other identified contributing factors were poor crew coordination, performing steps out of sequence, and failure to use written procedures.  
      
     ",TRUE,"  
        Nylon straps have a significantly higher amount of &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; than most other lifting hardware.  Alternative methods should be used when supporting structure in close proximity to an aircraft or other equipment.  
    

        During a lifting or supporting process, &ldquo;choker&rdquo; loops will continue to tighten and release more of the strap length until the load takes all the slack out. Alternative methods should be used when supporting structure in close proximity to an aircraft or other equipment.  

        In most instances, removing hardware from an existing upright structure should be accomplished in reverse order from the installation procedure.  

        A written procedure and a detailed crew brief would have specified the step-by-step process to the crew members and could have prevented this incident.

2/17/2005,1517,Aeronautics Research," During welding operations at the E-Complex in support of the Full-Volume RP Construction Project at Stennis Space Center, a fire occurred as a result of welding/cutting operations being performed on Level 5 of the E-1 Test Stand. The Mishap Investigation Team concluded that the proximate cause of this Type C incident was hot welding slag igniting combustible material under and near the vicinity of the welding/cutting operation. Contractor failure to follow procedures associated with hot work permits due to schedule pressure contributed to the incident, as well as lack of training and overburdened supervisory personnel. ",FALSE,"
        If not managed appropriately, schedule pressures will result in the degradation of formal work processes and safe engineering practices as well as erode the execution of proper supervision.  

        Failure to verify proper training and apply thorough supervision will lead to safety incidents.

Because the Michelson interferometer used on GIFTS utilizes a translating end mirror to change and continuously scan the optical path, the frames of FPA are collected at constant Optical Path Difference (OPD) intervals over the entire scan. The interferometer mirror&raquo;s translation rate and its corresponding OPD change rate are not perfectly linear. Thus, the FPA collection frame rate will vary with time.

2/2/2005,1525,Aeronautics Research," The NASA F-15 Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS) project team has developed a series of flight control concepts designed to demonstrate the benefits of a neural network-based adaptive controller. The objective of the team is to develop and flight-test control systems that use neural network technology to optimize the performance of the aircraft under nominal conditions as well as stabilize the aircraft under failure conditions. Failure conditions include locked or failed control surfaces as well as unforeseen damage that might occur to the aircraft in flight. The IFCS team is currently in the process of implementing a second generation control scheme, collectively known as Gen 2, for flight testing on the NASA F-15 aircraft.  
      
    The research controller is a dynamic inverse controller based on the Versatile Control Augmentation System (VCAS) control laws developed by James Buckley at McDonnell Douglas Aircraft. The baseline control laws were taken from the F-15 ACTIVE ILTV program, but the IFCS team has removed the thrust vectoring controls for the Gen 2 implementation.

    This document presents several lessons learned and recommendations for proactive measures to prevent a recurrence of this unfortunate accident. They may be considered applicable to any government/contractor collaborative relationship established to build, test, and launch space flight hardware. The lessons learned relate to the Integration and Test (I&amp;T) phase of the satellite development life cycle and are particularly relevant to long duration projects.  
      
     ",FALSE,"The lessons learned in the NOAA-N Prime mishap are listed below. They are not profound; they are all obvious. The accident occurred because a long duration program that had experienced several years of high performance success grew complacent, both at the government and at the contractor. The rules were relaxed, shortcuts were taken, product assurance grew sloppy, and proper oversight was not applied. The recommended actions are equally straightforward. Obey the rules, follow the procedures proactively, train the team, always consider systems safety, and provide effective independent oversight.  
      
    In order to emphasize specific points, ten lessons are identified. The lessons are not independent, stand alone items. All are interrelated facets of the overall NOAA-N Prime mishap lesson which is to perform I&amp;T and I&amp;T oversight diligently.  
      
     

      
        Past success does not guarantee current performance  

        Periodically update NASA contract requirements on long duration contracts  

        Conduct periodic training in I&amp;T roles and responsibilities  

        Effective safety program is essential  

        Handling flight hardware is never routine  

        Procedure execution discipline is essential  

        Develop clear documentation, minimize use of redlines  

        Perform advanced I&amp;T planning  

        Provide configuration control of ground support equipment that interfaces to flight hardware  

        An effective government in-plant office is needed  
      
    The NOAA-N Prime lessons learned are applicable to spacecraft development contractors and to the government organizations that hold the contracts. Under most NASA prime contracts, the spacecraft vendors are wholly responsible for the development of the satellite. The existence of government representatives who monitor contractor performance does not relieve the contractor of their end item responsibilities. However, since the independent assurance value of government oversight is diminished unless it is rigorously applied, most of the recommendations in this document address both the contractor and the government.   
      
    Each lesson learned is described below followed by the recommendation for that lesson.   
      
      

    1. Past success does not guarantee current performance</br>
  
    Lessons Learned:   
      
    The NOAA-N Prime accident occurred after three intense and productive years on the spacecraft contract. Work completed during those three years included two successful launches (NOAA-L in September 2000, NOAA-M in June 2002), dynamics testing of NOAA-N (NOAA-N is a different satellite than NOAA-N Prime), thermal vacuum testing of NOAA-N, dynamics testing of NOAA-N Prime and thermal vacuum testing of NOAA-N Prime. Because so much had been accomplished over an extended period, both the government and the contractor were lulled into believing that this high performance level was normal and would be sustained on its own. It was assumed that I&amp;T operations were being conducted in compliance with requirements. It was assumed that contractor and government oversight provided the necessary checks and balances. The contractor and the NASA project office considered the NOAA-N Prime spacecraft tilt operation scheduled for September 6, 2003 as routine because numerous tilts had been performed. Neither the government nor the contractor worried about I&amp;T operations on a Saturday because I&amp;T had been performed six days a week for years on the program. The accident caught everyone by surprise; no one saw it coming. The government and the contractor were overconfident and complacent based on past successes.   
      
    The lesson learned is that successful performance in the past does not predict success in the future, especially on long duration projects. Even the most extraordinary effort in the past does not guarantee that future efforts will be sustained at the same high quality level. Proactive measures must be taken to maintain a highly functional I&amp;T environment. This necessitates leadership to guard against complacency and take action against it, discipline and enforcement.   
      
    Formal guidelines are needed to regulate I&amp;T. Each spacecraft operation must be planned in advance, even if it has been performed many times. The I&amp;T test procedures must be correct and clearly written. Each team member must be trained in his responsibilities. The correct make up of the I&amp;T crew by skill mix and the required independent verifiers must be present for each operation. Strict discipline must be enforced on the I&amp;T floor. Stamping policy must be enforced, procedure steps should not be bought off unless personally performed or witnessed. System safety must be everyone&raquo;s concern. Operations planned for weekends require the full I&amp;T team, just as any other day of the week. The procedures must be rigorously followed during execution. The managers should permit no shortcuts regardless of the number of times an operation has been performed. Even if the I&amp;T crew is completely familiar with the operation and had performed it successfully many time
    before, procedure execution discipline must be maintained. It is essential that the government members of the I&amp;T team follow the same rules as the contractor or else the value of independent oversight is severely reduced.   
      

     2. Periodically update generic NASA contract requirements on long duration contracts  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Overall NASA requirements, standards, and guidelines for space flight hardware development are incrementally improved and evolve over time to incorporate advances in aerospace engineering and management practices. Applicable requirements are imposed on NASA contracts at contract start in order to improve the satellite design, manufacturing, and test process to the most current requirements, standards, and guidelines. This lesson learned refers to these general standards and requirements, such as EEE parts control and spacecraft orbital debris analysis, not contract unique requirements like satellite or instrument specifications.   
      
    The spacecraft contract was 15 years old at the time of the NOAA-N Prime accident. The contract was not initially planned to be that long, but additional satellites including NOAA-N Prime were added after 6 years, extending the performance period. Many of the contract requirements had not been changed since the contract started. Deliverable plans were submitted and approved in the first year of the contract and then, for the most part, archived and rarely referenced. For example, the contractor&raquo;s System Safety Implementation Plan was delivered in the 1980s and never updated in spite of three corporate turnovers and change in the location of the satellite manufacturing plant in 1998 from the East Coast to the West Coast. The contract&raquo;s system safety requirements related mainly to launch site safety, which was the main NASA safety emphasis at the time the contract started in 1988. Since then, NASA has significantly expanded system safety requirements to apply throughout the spacecraft development life cycle. But, the NOAA-N Prime contractor was not asked to update the System Safety Implementation Plan.  
      
    The lesson learned is that long duration contracts should be periodically (perhaps every 5 years) reviewed by the responsible government organization to ensure that the generic NASA requirements are up to date. If they do not meet current NASA policy relevant to the contract, the contracts should be modified to add the new requirements, or delete items no longer needed. The new requirements must first be reviewed to determine that they are applicable to the contract, not all new requirements should be automatically added. Examples of new requirements are IT security, specific system engineering analysis tools, risk management requirements, new releases of applicable documents, and independent review requirements. Implementing new requirements will add cost to the contract, so budget needs to be allocated for this purpose.  
      
    Plans that were submitted early after contract start should be reviewed periodically by the contractor and the government to determine whether they need updating. These plans describe how a function, such as configuration management or software management, will be performed during contract execution. Plans may need updating because implementations can change over time due to things such as company internal requirements changes, contract requirements changes, organizational changes, new technologies applied, and corporate mergers. The review and update process will add cost to the contract, so budget needs to be allocated for this purpose.  
      
    Major aerospace contractors have their own corporate requirements, standards, and policies that are imposed on all the work performed by the company. The companies should, on their own initiative, review their contracted work periodically to ensure that their corporate requirements are being fulfilled.  
      

    3. Conduct periodic training in I&amp;T roles and responsibilities  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Experience in I&amp;T does not eliminate the need for training as the NOAA-N Prime mishap demonstrated. The I&amp;T team on the floor at the time of the accident was comprised entirely of experienced workers on the NOAA satellites. In spite of their experience, they did not correctly perform their jobs on the day of the accident. The instrument shimming operation planned for the day of the mishap had been hurriedly put together; the test procedure was scissored out of existing procedures without a clear top level road map. The Responsible Test Engineer (RTE) did not have the full I&amp;T team present as required by the test procedure on the day of the accident, but he proceeded anyway. System safety engineering was not called to participate in the operation as required by the procedure for a hazardous operation, so no safety engineering representative was present when the tilt began. The government quality representative was called and he gave verbal permission to start without
    him. He was not present when the tilt began. The test procedure statement about assuring the configuration of the turn over cart was ambiguous. The RTE did not physically examine the configuration of the turn over cart, because he had used it a few weeks earlier on NOAA-N, and relied on paper logs to verify the configuration. (Unknown to the RTE, bolts securing the adapter plate had been removed from the cart since he had last used it.) A member of the I&amp;T team questioned the cart configuration but the RTE, without examining the cart, told him that the cart was configured correctly.   
      
    The lesson learned is self evident: experience in I&amp;T is not enough, the I&amp;T team must perform their work correctly and they need to know what is expected of them. Training is needed to instruct the I&amp;T team how to perform their work properly. Each member of the team, including the government and company quality witnesses, must understand their job and their roles around high value flight hardware. Lead test conductors must be certified to have the appropriate qualifying experience as well as the supervisory discipline and training needed to assume responsibility for the flight hardware. The Responsible Test Engineer must understand that procedures must be followed; the proper I&amp;T crew, product assurance, safety, government monitors must be present; and hazardous operations need special care. The product assurance representatives must understand their roles as witnesses and they must be trained to not buy off procedure steps unless they have personally witnessed
    them.Everyone needs to be concerned about the safety of people and high value flight hardware. If any member of the team has a question or a doubt, it should be investigated, not dismissed. Each member of the team should be empowered to halt an operation. Organizational practices must be established to reinforce the role and responsibility of contractor and government inspectors as independent verification agents.   
      
    Long duration contracts and/or contracts for multiple satellites need extra attention. While there are advantages to being familiar with the spacecraft and the I&amp;T process, training must also address how to keep the workers mentally engaged given the repetitive nature of some I&amp;T work. Complacency must be avoided. Each operation must be carefully planned and executed, regardless of how many times it was run before.  
      
    Training cannot be learned solely in a classroom setting. It should include various venues such as discussion groups, lectures, on line training, use of hardware and software simulators, documentation, mentoring, and on the job training by watching experienced personnel. Training should also include stories of how things went wrong on other projects with the lesson being: it could happen to us.   
      
    Training is not a one-time activity. It must be a continual proactive process, a constant admonition to work correctly. The I&amp;T team must be repeatedly reminded of their responsibilities and everyone needs to take it seriously. Program training and need dates for refresher training should be tracked. Certifications must be regularly renewed.  
      
    Contractor product assurance personnel need additional training in quality assurance and safety. The requirement for their independent verification function must be repeatedly emphasized. Stamping policy must be enforced. Quality should not buy off procedure steps without witnessing them. Similarly, government quality personnel need training in their oversight responsibilities.  
      
    Supervisors should receive additional training in the management of I&amp;T personnel. Supervisors must take an active role in monitoring the performance of their employees. If any employees are not meeting the requirements, the supervisors must arrange for further training or other appropriate corrective actions. Poor performance cannot be tolerated. Supervisors must always follow the requirements in their own work and be a role model for their employees.  
      
    The training and certification program must include emphasis on team roles and responsibilities. Good communication among all team members is essential while planning and executing I&amp;T operations. The government and the contractor should work together to define roles of each member of the I&amp;T team, including the government team. Contractor roles include the test conductor, technicians, engineering, systems safety, and quality engineering. If NASA has delegated specific product assurance functions to the Defense Contract Management Agency and NASA has also retained some independent quality oversight responsibilities, the respective functions must be clarified to the contractor so that the right people can be notified prior to the I&amp;T operation. The in-plant government I&amp;T team members should participate in the same training as the contractors, as well as additional training defined by DCMA and NASA.   
      
    The training program should be carefully developed to focus on the problem areas. Too much training may be counterproductive. When training becomes overkill, people may actually pay less attention. Training must be appropriate in both quantity and content in order to be effective.   
      

    4. Effective safety program is essential  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    System safety did not receive high priority at the contractor or the responsible government organization prior to the NOAA-N Prime accident. System safety was not fully integrated into the I&amp;T team. System safety representatives were not contacted by the I&amp;T team on the day of the accident to witness the hazardous NOAA-N Prime tilt operation as required by the procedure. Hence, there was no safety expert present on the I&amp;T floor at the time of the accident. Government safety was mainly concerned with launch site safety and not with the day-to-day operations at Sunnyvale. Before the accident, there was insufficient safety support on the program both at the contractor&raquo;s site and in the responsible government organization.  
      
    Safety of personnel and flight hardware is a serious matter and should be priority one. Safety support must not be tailored to resources available. An effective system safety program is needed at both the government and the contractor to protect people from injury and to keep high value flight hardware secure. Every member of the contractor and the government team needs to understand that safety is everyone&raquo;s responsibility. The contractor&raquo;s safety program should meet current safety requirements. Safety related training should be provided to all contractor and government team members. Satellite development contractors need to have system safety involved in every step of the satellite life cycle. Enough safety engineers must be assigned to the project to perform the necessary work; safety engineering should not be a part time function drawn from a centralized corporate safety engineering pool. Safety engineers should participate in satellite design, manufacturing and
    I&amp;T. Safety engineers should be involved with the design of flight hardware and ground support equipment to make them as safe as possible, participate in materials and parts selection, evaluate manufacturing techniques for compliance with safety requirements, perform hazard analysis, determine which I&amp;T operations are safety critical and how to best execute them, perform operational hazard analysis, witness hazardous I&amp;T operations to ensure that all safety precautions have been taken, document launch site safety issues, and keep up with aerospace safety engineering practices. I&amp;T operations must not proceed without safety representatives present when documented in procedural requirements. The contractor must rigorously adhere to safety requirements.   
      
    The government must have a strong system safety program with sufficient safety engineers to oversee the contractor&raquo;s safety implementation. The government&raquo;s system safety program must implement up to date NASA safety policy, and impose them on the contractor. The government&raquo;s safety program must work closely with the contractor to monitor their performance and review safety related deliverable documentation. The government&raquo;s safety engineers must provide safety training to the government staff. Government safety should perform safety audits periodically to evaluate the contractor&raquo;s critical processes and procedures.  
      

    5. Handling flight hardware is never routine  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Special care must always be taken when handling high value flight hardware. Regardless of how many times a particular I&amp;T operation has been performed, focused attention is required when a critical or hazardous operation is performed. The NOAA-N Prime accident occurred when a hazardous operation was treated as routine, a short handed I&amp;T crew was working, and the procedures were not followed. The Responsible Test Engineer felt that the turn over cart was properly configured because he had used it a few weeks earlier on NOAA-N which he verified by checking the paperwork. He did not actually examine the cart as required by procedure. Had he looked at the cart matched against the drawing, he should have noticed the missing bolts from the adapter plate. The bolts are large and clearly visible when properly installed. Even when one of the technicians questioned the cart&raquo;s configuration, the RTE did not look at the cart. In this case, handling the flight hardware and
    using the turn over cart was considered so ordinary by the RTE, that he did not bother to physically look at the ground equipment on which he planned to rotate a fully assembled satellite.   
      
    Rules should be developed by the government and the contractor on how to conduct I&amp;T. Each I&amp;T operation should be fully planned in advance with system safety as the paramount concern. I&amp;T procedures must be developed to control and guide the proper handling of flight hardware and these must be followed during I&amp;T operations. I&amp;T procedures must be clearly written, those that contain hazardous operations must be clearly marked on the document cover and within the pertinent procedural steps. Flight hardware must be treated with respect, each operation should be executed with care as though it was the first time it was being performed. Periodic training is needed to keep the I&amp;T personnel mentally alert for repetitive operations on long duration contracts. The I&amp;T team should not feel hampered or overly constrained, but they should always be cognizant of the value of the flight hardware and the need to work with it cautiously. Procedure execution
    discipline must beenforced so that the proper I&amp;T crew needed for that operation is assembled for each operation, procedures are followed and each step independently witnessed. Product assurance personnel must function effectively as independent verifiers. No assumptions should be made about the state of the spacecraft and ground support equipment (within reason, ground support equipment does not need to be torn down and built up after a shift change). Every team member should feel empowered to voice concerns and not have them ignored. There must be open communication among the team members.   
      

    6. Procedure execution discipline is essential  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Procedure execution discipline must be sustained by the I&amp;T team. The NOAA-N Prime accident occurred in part because the procedures were not followed. An incomplete I&amp;T crew was assembled to run the operation. System safety was not notified to send a representative as required by the procedure. The government quality representative was called when the operation started, but he told the Responsible Test Engineer to start without him and he would get there later. He should have been present in the clean room at the start of the hazardous spacecraft tilt operation, but he did not arrive until after the accident occurred. The Responsible Test Engineer started the operation with these people absent, in violation of procedure requirements. Quality representatives affixed their stamps to attest that they witnessed certain procedure steps before the accident, when in fact they had not. Quality assurance failed to function as an independent authority carefully double checking all work. One member of the I&amp;T team actually questioned the configuration of the turn over cart, but the RTE did not go to look at it, instead he told the technician he was wrong. These lapses of procedure execution discipline and the failure to acknowledge the opinion of a member of the I&amp;T crew resulted in the terrible NOAA-N Prime accident.   
      
    Spacecraft I&amp;T is difficult work with little margin for error, often involving flight hardware worth hundreds of millions of dollars. I&amp;T should be performed according to established policies and configuration controlled procedures. The workers and their management must be sincere about following these rules. Procedures should not be run without the full I&amp;T team present required for the operation. A pre operations meeting should be held so that all personnel understand the operation to be performed. Operation sign-off must occur with personal cognizance of the participants or independent validators. Only those procedure steps actually performed and/or witnessed should be stamped off. Procedure instructions must be clearly communicated and understood by all personnel involved in the operation. I&amp;T test procedures should be clearly written. Vague words like &ldquo;assure&rdquo; and &ldquo;verify&rdquo; should not be used; they should be replaced with specific actions
    having measurable results where possible. I&amp;T team members should be able to ask questions at any time and every I&amp;T team member should know that he is authorized to stop an operation if he feels there is a problem. Government presence required by a procedure can only be waived by approval from the Project Office&raquo;s System Assurance Manager. Waiving mandatory government I&amp;T presence should be rarely, if ever, permitted.  
      
    The role of the government must be clear. Which government I&amp;T responsibilities are delegated by NASA to DCMA should be known to everyone in the contractor&raquo;s and government&raquo;s organizations. NASA responsibilities on the I&amp;T floor should be defined so that the contractor understands each type of oversight. The contractor must track, examine, categorize and trend the nature and closure of the contractor identified non-conformance reports or the DCMA generated Corrective Action Requests. The government must also monitor and track the closure of actions, deficiencies, and recommendations resulting from outside audits and reviews. All results should be shared with the contractor. Corrective measures to improve I&amp;T should be jointly developed with the contractor and jointly monitored for effectiveness.  
      
    There must be consequences if procedure execution discipline is not followed. I&amp;T employees need to be told by their supervisors what is expected of them. Poor performers should not have access to high value flight hardware. The supervisors must lead by example and follow all the rules themselves.  
      

    7. Develop clear documentation, minimize use of redlines  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    The operation being run on the day of the NOAA-N Prime mishap was a unique, one-time activity. It consisted of removing an instrument, installing a shim, and reinstalling the instrument. Individual segments of the operation, such as the instrument installation, were documented in released and previously run I&amp;T test procedures. But, instead of developing a new procedure for the shimming operation, portions of existing procedures were cobbled together with red-lines. This made it difficult to follow the flow as it wove in and out of various procedures In addition, portions of the existing procedures were red-lined. All of this out of sequence activity may have confused the I&amp;T crew and contributed to the mishap.   
      
    Red-lines are useful tools that enable the continuation of an I&amp;T operation when minor unexpected problem arise. But, the use of red-lines must be minimized and carefully controlled. Red-lines must be clearly understood and appropriate to the operation before they are executed. If a procedure is red-lined during an I&amp;T operation because of an unforeseen circumstance, there must be concurrence by the independent product assurance personnel and government quality witnesses. If any member of the I&amp;T team questions the red-line, then the operation should be stopped and the issue resolved with the cognizant engineering personnel.  
      
    Red-lines must be documented as either one-time or permanent for future procedure use. It is up to the contractor&raquo;s product assurance organization and government oversight to ensure that red-lines are not used on the floor repeatedly. If a red-line is determined to be a permanent change, then the procedure should be formally updated through the established configuration control review and approval process.  
      
    The contractor and the government should audit the use of red-lines to assure that they are used appropriately. If excessive use of red-lines are found, corrective measures should be taken by the contractor.   
      

    8. Perform advanced I&amp;T planning  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Sufficient time must be allocated to prepare for each I&amp;T operation according to approved configuration management requirements. The NOAA-N Prime instrument shimming operation was inserted into the I&amp;T schedule on a Thursday with the intent to execute it two days later on Saturday. There was a rush to develop the authorizing paperwork. The preparation of the I&amp;T procedure for an operation that had never been performed in this sequence was hurried. It was difficult to assemble an I&amp;T team on short notice, most technicians who were approached on Friday about working on Saturday declined.   
      
    No I&amp;T operation has such urgency that planning can be bypassed. All new I&amp;T operations must be carefully planned and communicated to all participants. It should not be a race against time to prepare the paperwork and search out an I&amp;T team. The focus of a new I&amp;T operation should be on accurately preparing it. System safety considerations must be made. All configuration management steps must be followed to develop new procedures. A full review should be made of the procedure by all appropriate groups (system engineering, I&amp;T, quality, safety, government, etc.) prior to the release of a new procedure.   
      
    There are times when a complete procedure cannot be developed in advance, such as while troubleshooting an intermittent problem where the follow on steps vary based on the test results. Even in these cases, there should be time to plan the basic approach and assemble the correct I&amp;T team.  
      
    The government should be aware of the amount of time it takes to prepare I&amp;T documentation and should not allow the contractor to work with the flight hardware without the required paperwork. The contractor&raquo;s product assurance organization should not allow an operation to proceed if it has not fully matured. The NASA in-plant representatives or DCMA should stop any operation that does not appear to be properly planned.  
      

    9. Provide configuration control of ground support equipment that interfaces to flight hardware  
      
    Lessons Learned:  
      
    Two different spacecraft programs were housed in the same high bay, clean room complex when the NOAA-N Prime accident occurred. Each had multiple satellites in production. The programs used similar mechanical ground equipment including two functionally identical satellite turn over carts. There were two turn over carts that could be used by either program when configured correctly. This shared equipment was not maintained under configuration control. The prevailing philosophy at the time of the mishap was that the configuration of the mechanical ground equipment should be checked prior to use in an I&amp;T operation.  
      
    The accident occurred because the procedure to assure that the turn over cart was in the proper configuration was not followed. The root cause of the accident was the bolts that attached the adapter plate to the turn over cart were missing, so the satellite fell off the cart as it was being tilted from vertical to horizontal. Had the turn over cart been under configuration control, the bolts should not have been removed without the proper authority and coordination with the I&amp;T team that was using the turn over cart.  
      
    All ground equipment, mechanical and electrical, that interfaces to flight hardware should be under configuration control. Electrical ground equipment, especially software systems, must be configured items maintained in a known, reproducible state. Data base values, limits, coefficients, flight software load images, ground software, calibration status, etc. must all be controlled so that spacecraft test results can be evaluated and compared from test to test. Similarly, mechanical ground equipment must be controlled in a known state. Proof testing data, drawings and schematics, failure modes effects analysis, operational hazard analysis, etc. must be available so that the equipment can be used with confidence. Configuration c"
1/1/2005,1573,Aeronautics Research," Key subordinate project management positions must be truly accountable to the Project Manager.  Sub-project managers must be empowered to manage and make decisions pertaining to their element of the project.  Roles, responsibilities and authority of SP managers should be agreed to by line and project management and formally documented up front.  The sub-project managers should be recognized as having the appropriate management authority necessary to make key decisions in both the direction of the work and the funding required to accomplish it.  The Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) Project perspective is that ideally such key positions as sub-project managers should report directly to the project manager.  Any agreements and arrangements for matrix organizational support must be carefully thought out, documented and communicated to all involved organizations including management (all levels) and those responsible to do the work.  Special attention should be given to assure this support is indeed provided through the life of the project and that continuity is maintained when personnel inevitably turnover.  AATT experienced a significant amount of key position turnovers and in some instances new managers reinvented the wheel which has an effect on all support staff impacting overall effectiveness and efficiency.  
     ",TRUE," Without proper authority and accountability to appropriate line management, the efficiency and effectiveness of individual subordinate support managers is significantly diminished.  This can have a detrimental and even disruptive effect both on day-to-day work and ability to achieve successful project milestones and deliverables on time and on schedule.

1/1/2005,1581,Aeronautics Research," There is an extensive history of resistance thermal device (RTD) failures on NASA and DOD missions due to thermally-induced mechanical stress. Recent MER ground and in-flight failures, including some failures in mission critical MER applications, suggest that these devices remain sensitive to variations in the mounting configuration. Perform Package Qualification Verification (PQV) for all critical RTD applications. For non-critical applications, develop standard, flight qualified installations and methods, and track the part pedigree.  
     ",TRUE," When viewed against a history of RTD failures related to mechanical stress during NASA and military missions, recent JPL failures suggest that these devices remain sensitive to variations in bond joint geometry and in device and surface mount materials. Hence, package qualification verification (PQV) may be particularly suited to predicting RTD failure- arguably more suited than a collective mechanical design guideline for packaging (e.g., 155 deg C range for 200 cycles). The need for PQV may be overlooked in plans and contracts because hardware featuring RTDs may be mistakenly considered to be purely mechanical assemblies. Also, a problem with qualifying a single standard mounting configuration is the lack of analytical insight into what changes may invalidate the flight qualification.

1/1/2005,1610,Aeronautics Research," A senior individual with decades of experience on many space flight projects, including several X-vehicle programs, has made the observation that the engineering data is consistently reduced in favor of other aspects of the mission (performance, scientific data, simplicity).  
     ",TRUE,"  
        All missions, successful or unsuccessful, need an adequate amount of engineering instrumentation in order to be useful for the future.  

      

        Contractors have no incentive to provide engineering data as collecting it adds weight and complexity and may not contribute to the success of mission (unless there is a problem). Thus, the risk management aspects of the data may not be appreciated since it only comes into play if the current mission has a problem or in helping design future missions.

1/1/2005,1564,Aeronautics Research," A.  Reviews: General Feedback Received From All Levels of Project Participants-  
    There are too many reviews without clear definition of their purpose.  As a result, reviews tended to overlap in their charters and often provided conflicting recommendations.  Those involved in projects would be more motivated to support reviews if they could see and experience distinct and valuable purposes that each review served.  Independent review committees are not slowed (or do not take) adequate review time to understand the project's work, accomplishments, etc. and alignment with schedule and budget.  As a result, many of the findings are incorrect or misleading as a result of misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about the project.

1/1/2005,1562,Aeronautics Research," The Agency has aggressively committed to pursue performance tracking such as Earned Value Management (EVM). However, given the constraints of operating within the restrictions and limitations of a government agency, EVM can be very difficult and in some situations impossible to attain. The AATT Project made a serious attempt to implement EVM and both ATMSDI contractors reported monthly EVM status to the AATT Project Office. Additionally, the Project Office hired an EVM subject matter expert and attempted to track EVM utilizing in-house civil service labor plans and acturals. This was prior to implementation of an Agency-wide generic full cost accounting system. The AATT effort proved to be labor intensive and would have required creation of over 100 individual job order (account) numbers in the Ames financial system alone in order to accurately capture and track individual task level work plans and actuals. In fact, Ames&raquo; financial management organization did not react favorably to the prospect of so many cost accounts for a number of reasons (additional workload being one). Without the necessary level of detail in collecting planned and actual expenses, Earned Value Management effectiveness becomes severely compromised. The AATT Project found that the level of information gained did not justify the workload placed on the task leads and/or PIs or the AATT Systems Management Staff.

In implementing the custom requirement set and associated verification testing for these TCs notable anomalies/problems were encountered in two areas. The primary problem was the discovery of contamination (mostly Carbon deposits) on the inner surfaces of the TC that led to acceptance test failures. A secondary problem was caused by attempting to maximize the TC wire size yet limiting the overall TC sheath diameter leading to assembly problems of each TC. ,FALSE," Mechanical means of cleaning/scrubbing inside surfaces removes most particulate contamination. Vacuum baking of the individual piece parts has limited effectiveness in removing contaminants. Use of the Alcohol-based solvents for cleaning leads to deposits on the surfaces of the piece parts and also can be absorbed into the surfaces (esp. HaO insulator). The potential of contaminant deposit on the inside of the TC during acceptance testing, including operating temperature calibration, requires careful selection of cleaning agents as well as the cleaning of all parts prior to assembly and keeping all parts clean throughout the assembly and testing process. Use of alcohol-based cleaners should be avoided as they have a tendency to be absorbed into the materials and then during high temperature operations will be deposited as Carbon on all inside surfaces of the TC thus causing TC failure during ATP. Use of mild soap and water (deionized) is the preferable final cleaning agent.
    Carefully evaluate the tolerances, clearances and characteristics of the parts required for assembly and procure extra hardware piece parts to facilitate assemble.

1/1/2005,1563,Aeronautics Research," A senior individual with experience in many space flight projects, including several X-vehicles, has observed that the aerospace industry has changed and there are many indirect costs associated with doing business with NASA.  
     ",TRUE," Without an appropriate monetary incentive, private industry will not maintain a capability that is required for NASA type of missions.  This will affect the cost of all NSAA exploration missions and can include:  
      
    &bull; Costs of obtaining and sharing proprietary information, especially when several contractors are involved  
    &bull; Costs of developing and maintaining sufficient expertise in NASA-specific domains to have competitive acquisition programs or the cost of not having sufficient NASA domain expertise

1/1/2005,1561,Aeronautics Research," A. Reviews: General feedback received from all levels of project participants - There are too many reviews without clear definition of their purpose. As a result, reviews tended to overlap in their charters and often provided conflicting recommendations. Those involved in projects would be more motivated to support reviews if they could see and experience distinct, valuable purposes that each review served.  
      
    Independent review committees are not allowed (or do not take) adequate review time to understand the project&iacute;s work, accomplishments, etc. and alignment with schedule and budget.

1/1/2005,1553,Aeronautics Research," Key subordinate project management positions must be truly accountable to the Project Manager. Sub-project managers must be empowered to manage and make decisions pertaining to their element of the project. Roles, responsibilities and authority of SP managers should be agreed to by line and project management and formally documented up front. The sub-project managers should be recognized as having the appropriate management authority necessary to make key decisions in both the direction of the work and the funding required to accomplish it. The AATT Project&raquo;s perspective is that ideally such key positions as sub-project managers should report directly to the project manager. Any agreements and arrangements for matrix organizational support must be carefully thought out, documented and communicated to all involved organizations including management (all levels) and those responsible to do the work. Special attention should be given to assure this support is indeed provided throughout the life of the project and that continuity is maintained when personnel inevitably turnover. AATT experienced a significant amount of key position turnovers and in some instances new managers &ldquo;reinvented the wheel&rdquo; which has an effect on all support staff impacting overall effectiveness and efficiency.  
     ",FALSE," Without proper authority and accountability to appropriate line management, the efficiency and effectiveness of individual subordinate support managers is significantly diminished. This can have a detrimental and even disruptive effect both on day-to-day work and ability to achieve successful project milestones and deliverables on time and on schedule.  
     "
1/1/2005,1555,Aeronautics Research," Most all projects in today&raquo;s environment invariably require the cooperation and support of multiple organizations both in development and acceptance of project deliverables (including multiple government agencies, the project&raquo;s customers, educational institutions and potential industry stakeholders and users). With resources scarce at all levels and close oversight and scrutiny (both internally and externally), the importance of the inevitable matrix organizations established to carry out programs and projects from formulation through implementation cannot be overemphasized.  
      
    The AATT Project made a significant effort in communicating and developing agreements with key partners such as the FAA, as a primary receiver/user of the Project&raquo;s products. A multitude of Memorandum of Understanding/Agreements, etc, were established and utilized during the life of this project. Clearly, the partnership with the FAA proved to be the Project&raquo;s greatest challenge.  
      
    With continuous management and organizational changes at all levels, policy and procedure changes, etc., AATT experienced problems, as grouped and summarized below:  
      
    A. Interacting with, and learning to work with an entirely different federal agency such as the FAA: It took much time and resources to experience and understand key cultural and organizational differences involving everything from policy, procedures, politics, and communication processes in both technical and administrative/management domains. Comments at all levels across the AATT Project demonstrate that this was one of the most significant ongoing challenges. The FAA failed for a number of reasons to provide consistent single points of contact (POC) for any appreciable length of time. One manager reports that &ldquo;the average life&rdquo; of an FAA POC has been less than 2 years&rdquo;. Also, unexpected union issues and concerns ensued with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), which were increased since AATT had a presence at more than one FAA facility. To further complicate things, continual shifts
    and/orreorganizations within the FAA resulted in AATT technology being moved from organization to organization constantly requiring NASA managers and researchers to educate and establish relationships with new FAA personnel.  
      
    B. Resource Support: As the AATT Project matured, FAA commitments to provide joint support funding, personnel and/or facilities declined for a number of reasons. AATT learned the high risk this really is from the start and how it can lead to de-scoping, schedule delays or tradeoffs not originally foreseen.  
      
    C. Technical Transfer of Project Products: AATT invested much time and energy in working with a number of FAA POCs at various levels to establish an agreed upon process and understanding of technologies to be passed on for further development and implementation into the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA has stated that they are often unprepared for the research NASA develops that they are then expected to further develop and implement into the operational environment. The AATT tailored TRL (Technology Readiness Level) process has been used for these purposes. An ongoing problem AATT has experienced is the FAA&raquo;s desire and need to know how a newly developed NASA technology being handed over, will fit into the evolving NAS.  
      
    D. External Agreements and Management Support: As indicated above, the AATT Project was subjected to much instability and organizational dynamics in its relationship to the FAA. Formal agreements that were made and in place between the FAA and the AATT Project regarding technologies to be prototyped, demonstrated, and transferred in support of stakeholder requirements were ignored. In light of this, it is crucial to gain long-term top-level management support from any and all key participating organizations including necessary resource commitments.  
      
     ",FALSE," For all of the above listed examples, the importance of establishing strong up-front relationships and communications between all levels of management authority down to working collaborations cannot be overemphasized. This is especially important when two large federal agencies are involved that must work successfully together to research and develop complex technical concepts and tools that must be passed from one to the other for implementation into the operational systems of the real world.  
     "
1/1/2005,1551,Aeronautics Research," The original Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) acquisition strategy identified a rough 70/30 % funding split between procurement and in-house dollars spent. Research and technical support organizations were allowed to make specific decisions in these matters as long as overall project and procurement guidelines and requirements were generally being met.  
      
    A number of inputs to the AATT request for &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong core competency in air traffic management research within the civil service staff. Maintaining a core competency is considered critical when adjusting to funding shortfalls, as well as maintaining appropriate technical focus and research product development. Additionally, certain contract support is more appropriate for on-site, as compared to off-site, out-of-the-area contract task support.  
      
     ",FALSE," The key &ldquo;lesson learned&rdquo; here is that core technical research and associated research support should be maintained within the NASA research cadre and on-site contractors.  
     "
1/1/2005,1579,Science," Building was not properly decommissioned. GSFC did not have formal procedures for decommissioning and transfer of ownership of buildings and/or systems (includes utilities, pneumatics and special systems such as fire suppression, etc.) that are not being utilized.  
     ",FALSE," Ensure that formal procedures are written that describe the process for de-commissioning buildings and/or systems.  
     "
11/29/2004,1519,Science," Because the Operations Storage Server was procured and installed very late in Phase D and featured unreliable, non-integrated hardware that could not reliably provide the dataflow performance required for critical MER mission operations, it posed a mission risk and had to be replaced just prior to EDL. Procure an integrated, expandable suite of server hardware that fully meets mission data throughput and reliability requirements, install the system at least nine months prior to its first planned operational use, and avoid subsequent major MOS/GDS IT infrastructure changes. ",FALSE," Critical mission dataflow (ground) components that are procured and implemented too late, or feature low performance, non-integrated hardware, are unlikely to reliably provide the speed and capability required by mission operations. "
11/1/2004,1518,Aeronautics Research," Because the MER Flight Control Team (FCT) was fully formed only one month prior to MER launch, critical software engineering and operations management problems resulted. Staff FCT participation in project development at the beginning of Phase C and assure continued FCT involvement in project activities. Or at a minimum, select a few operations team members for early training. ",FALSE,"  
        Inadequate involvement of Operations Engineering in project development may increase the risk to mission success.

10/11/2004,1529,Aeronautics Research," When a GSE power meter registered zero due to an AC power glitch, the test monitoring and control software interpreted this as a loss of power and increased the test level past the maximum rating of the test article. This ground test error could have damaged flight hardware. Perform FMEA on test equipment to identify all potential GSE-induced failure modes. Either program the test control software or insert a limiting hardware device to prevent overtest. ",FALSE, GSE failures can negate the test limits programmed into commercial test monitoring and control software applications. 
10/1/2004,1716,Science,Power cables in tight power cabinets are susceptible to damage from penetrating fasteners.,TRUE,Ensure that design and acceptance criteria are adequately developed and implemented to route conductors in panel enclosures away from fasteners and sharp edges.
10/1/2004,1718,Aeronautics Research,"Loss of maintenance schedules during contract turnover led to omission of panel from inspection schedule, increasing risk.",TRUE,Key as-built and maintenance records must be generated and managed as Government property.
8/23/2004,1483,Aeronautics Research," Shortly after the commencement of science activities on Mars, an MER rover lost the ability to execute any task that requested memory from the flight computer. The cause was incorrect configuration parameters in two operating system software modules that control the storage of files in system memory and flash memory. Seven recommendations cover enforcing design guidelines for COTS software, verifying assumptions about software behavior, maintaining a list of lower priority action items, testing flight software internal functions, creating a comprehensive suite of tests and automated analysis tools, providing downlinked data on system resources, and avoiding the problematic file system and complex directory structure. ",FALSE," A severely compressed flight software development schedule may prevent the achievement of a full understanding of software functions. During the MER software development process there was a continuous reprioritization of activities and focus. One impact of this dynamic process was that only the highest priority flight software issues and problems could be addressed, and memory management problems were viewed as a low risk. "
8/4/2004,1488,Science," The Fluids and Combustion Facility (FCF) project at the NASA Glenn Research Center subjected the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based Data Acquisition board to ionizing radiation testing to simulate the International Space Station US Lab radiation environment. Components on the board were irradiated by a 200 MeV proton beam and were exposed to a ten year equivalent dose (600 Rads with a 1.5 Safety margin) of ionizing radiation. All exposures resulted in destructive events in the DSP chips on board.  
      
    The Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based Data Acquisition board is a commercial off-the-shelf product that was not designed for space applications. There are four identical DSP chips on the board. The DSP chips are commercial microcircuits, also not intended for space applications. The DSP chips are utilized for image acquisition from FCF Serial Data Link (SDL) supported cameras.  
      
    No other devices on the Data Acquisition boards were observed to fail, however the boards were not tested beyond about 1-2% of the total intended proton fluence when the specific SHARC DSP chips were exposed directly.  
      
     ",FALSE," All COTS hardware must be tested/analyzed for susceptibility to ionizing radiation induced events, either recoverable or destructive, prior to being fully designed into space applications. The testing should be done early in the design cycle to minimize the schedule impact of any resulting redesign effort.  
      
    The testing of the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based Data Acquisition boards and the determination of their high level of susceptibility has resulted in the need for major re-designs late in the design effort driving schedule and cost issues for integrating the re-design.  
      
     "
8/2/2004,1484,Science," Early in the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) design phase, and in all modeling for operations and mission science return, planners assumed that each rover would be inoperable every third day, on average, due to problems. This planned margin contributed to mission success by giving operations personnel time to gain an understanding of problems, and to plan high-risk maneuvers, before taking action. For complex missions, provide sufficient margin in the planned mission science return to accommodate likely interruptions in the data flow. ",FALSE," For complex spaceflight missions, it is very likely that unforeseen factors will cause interruptions in the science data return.  
      
     "
7/20/2004,1486,Aeronautics Research," Formal, archival documentation of the original investigation and the subsequent tests and analyses conducted to resolve the problem of the cracks found in the flowliners at the gimbal joint of the LH2 feedlines of the Orbiter fleet were substantially incomplete. The discipline of preparing and peer reviewing formal engineering reports leads to a high degree of accuracy and technical rigor. ",FALSE," It has been two years since the cracks were originally discovered in the flowliners at the gimbal joint of the LH2 feedlines. In that time, numerous important observations, analyses, and tests have been accomplished. The ITA Team found extensive documentation archived on a web site (SSPWEB) maintained by the Program Office. However, the preponderance of documentation is in the form of briefing charts prepared for oral presentations. Also, the team found extensive technical information available from individual engineers working on the problem resolution team. Unfortunately, much of this information was not properly documented in formal engineering reports. Also, there is no evidence that critical findings were formally peer reviewed. While numerous examples of incomplete documentation could be sited, two specific examples are discussed below to illustrate the potential implications of the lack of technical rigor that might occur when formal documentation is not required and the
    results are not independently verified through peer review.  
      
    The location, orientation, and length of cracks originally found in the fleet in 2002 could not be determined from the original documentation given to the ITA Team. In fact, the numerous problem summary briefings given by engineers and senior team leaders, dating from August 2002 to January 2004, contained conflicting data on both the number of cracks found in each orbiter and the length of these cracks. To resolve these discrepancies, an extensive effort was required to re-analyze the original inspection data obtained in 2002. During this effort to establish accurate crack information, it was discovered that several cracks were kinked rather than extending in a self-similar crack growth direction as was implied by the sketches and analyses reported in the briefing charts. This is a significant finding because kinked cracks like those found in the orbiters, typically exhibit bifurcation behavior and change crack growth direction due to complexities in the global stress field. This
    is critical information in determining the root causes of the cracks observed in the fleet. In fact, incorrect conclusions regarding the problem resolution could have resulted from this omission of critical evidence.  
      
     As part of the investigation, two engine hot fire test series were conducted at Stennis Space Center. The purpose of these tests was to better understand the feedline flow physics and the associated forcing functions, which define the spectrum loadings on the flowliner. The first test series used a BTA with a fixed joint and without a flexible bellow. The second test series used a GTA with a gimbaled joint and flexible bellow. Not only did NASA invest considerable resources to conduct these tests, the interpretation of the test results has led to an escalation in concern over the structural integrity of the flowliners and an additional expenditure of tens of millions of dollars in an attempt to develop a new flight rationale. Yet, there is no formal test report that documents the calibration of instrumentation, test procedures, sequence of test events, test data acquisition, and post-test data reduction. Furthermore, there is no formal documentation of the engineering details
    regarding how the data was used to develop a loading spectrum and the associated prediction of the residual fatigue lives of the flowliners.  
      
     "
7/20/2004,1487,Aeronautics Research," One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome in resolving the problem of the cracks found in the flowliners at the gimbal joint of the LH2 feedlines of the Orbiter fleet has been the disparity of the propellant feed systems between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle. Ground testing should be conducted in as close to flight configuration as possible. Where differences between ground and flight configurations or environments are necessary, every effort to correlate the ground test data to actual flight situations must be made.
 ",TRUE," 
One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome in the flowliner investigation has been the disparity of the propellant feed systems between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle. NASA does not have a Flight-Configured Main Propulsion System (MPS) Ground Test Facility that accurately simulates the flight environment. Differences between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle can singularly and collectively degrade the fidelity of ground-based hot fire tests in characterizing the flight environment. Examples encountered during the course of this investigation include the following:
  

  Differences in the feedline weld bead in feedline between flowliners and SSME interface;  
  Differences in thermal insulation (i.e., vacuum jacket vs. BX-250 SOFI) on the feedlines;  
  Differences in feedline layout (i.e., line lengths, bends, flex joints, valves, flow meters); and  
  Differences in sensors and sensor locations.  
</ul>

The inability to accurately replicate the flight conditions of the MPS in a ground test has been a persistent difficulty in determining the fundamental root cause of the flowliner issue. Significant resources and schedule time have been expended to overcome the need for a test facility that replicates the collective environment (e.g., flow, structural, dynamic, thermal, etc.) of the actual flight vehicle. A facility dedicated to subjecting the engine and supporting feed system to a high-fidelity flight environment could be used for acceptance tests, green run tests, and fleet leader extension tests.The MPTA was useful in certifying the MPS for the shuttle, but was retired early in the program. It would not be necessary to configure the system to accommodate all the engines used in the MPS, but to replicate the fluid environment that one engine would be exposed to, with the flexibility of expanding the resolution of the system environment to include as many engines as needed. With regard to the MPS environment of subsequent vehicle programs, the instrumentation suite incorporated into the ground facility could be integrated into the propellant system without significant affect to the characterization of the system environment.

7/1/2004,1516,Aeronautics Research," The final proposal for this effort was approximately 58% higher than government estimates despite the fact that government estimates were derived from X-43A actual costs and were considered to be quite accurate. Do not underestimate the need for thorough project formulation and cost estimation, even when the project appears to be a straightforward follow-on effort.  
      
     ",FALSE," Program should allow adequate schedule for working through the formulation process. This will uncover sources of cost and schedule risk; it may not eliminate them, but the project can at least begin to set stakeholder expectations. Approach the cost estimation effort with the same zeal and require the same breadth of knowledge as one would for a major system design. Project formulation is often the first thing to be sacrificed as funding is allocated, schedule pressures build, and contracts are initiated. "
7/1/2004,1515,Aeronautics Research," A lack of adequate workforce in the early days of the project delayed development of plans and complicated the project's formulation. Each project should be treated as a new effort with adequate staff from the outset  
      
     ",FALSE," Lack of adequate staff during planning and formulation phases causes decreased quality of work output, forcing later revisions to correct problems. Lack of timely and adequate staffing places an unfair and stressful burden on the existing project management team. "
7/1/2004,1513,Aeronautics Research," Responsibilities were distributed throughout the consortium, but suppliers would only discuss issues with key decision makers, leaving the expediters and coordinators out of the information loop. Programs should define roles and responsibilities early all the way down to the supplier level with a clear focal point for communication.  
      
     ",FALSE," Definition of roles and responsibilities should take place early, be communicated clearly, and continually reinforced all the way down to the supplier level. There should be two-way, open communication so that all parties agree on the responsibilities and understand what is expected of all team-members. The team's core values should also be developed early in the team-building process, and encouragement of desirable behaviors should take place throughout the project life. "
7/1/2004,1590,Aeronautics Research," X-43C Project compiled and managed risk early in the project formulation.  NASA programs should prepare risk management plans early in project formulation and include budget analysis and Risk-based acquisition management (RBAM) activities to serve the project during formulation and startup.  
      
     ",TRUE," A thorough risk management plan and database keeps risks at the forefront of the decision-making process and provides a foundation checklist for the project team to communicate consistently both internally and externally.  
     "
7/1/2004,1588,Aeronautics Research," The NGLT middle-managers forum for integration across the program greatly improved overall program execution.
NASA programs should create a middle managersè forum for integration at the Program Office-level. Program managers should pay close attention to how middle managers integrate with their peers and ensure communication is fl owing, thus contributing to improving safety, eliminating duplication, and promoting good working relationships across the elements of the Program/Centers.
  
      
     ",TRUE," Creating a middle manager&raquo;s, peer-level forum for integration at the Program Office increased teamwork and improved communication across the Program. These middle managers were able to support each other&raquo;s efforts and avoid isolation where lack of integration could result in duplicate efforts and less than optimum progress on projects. Lack of middle-management integration impedes communication of unique critical information each manager possesses, and potentially creates silos that work against each other. The CAIB Report identifies a lack of integration as a driver of accidents wherein one element of a program is not cognizant of what another is doing. The program-level middle managers took it upon themselves to pre-empt this potentially harmful issue.  
     "
7/1/2004,1584,Aeronautics Research," Due to various internal and external drivers, recent space transportation programs have performed several cycles of program formulation, initiating and canceling projects prior to completion.  NASA should provide technical experts to review contractor data deliverables and provide independent analysis in critical, high-risk areas.  
      
     ",TRUE," Government insight is essential to success of large and complex projects, which significantly aids in risk identification and risk mitigation.  Both industry and government have responsibilities to support insight activities: industry has the responsibility to provide open and detailed information on technical and programmatic issues, while the government has the responsibility to use the information in a productive way.  The government cannot overreact to issues and must allow the contractor time to resolve problems.   Communications between the insight team and the contractor must be based on the desire to understand and add value.  These are considered appropriate roles for government to support high-risk space technology and space system development efforts.  
     "
7/1/2004,1527,Aeronautics Research," The X-43C Project budget and milestones were established well ahead of detailed cost and schedule analysis. Per Office of Aerospace Technology (OAT) policy at that time, no budget reserves or schedule margins were allowed. As project cost and schedule requirements grew, the only choice was to slip the first flight. The original spending profile was also not compatible with efficient procurement of flight hardware. Programs should establish preliminary project budgets with adequate reserves and schedule margin adjusting budget and spending profiles as better information is developed.  
      
     ",FALSE," Firm budgets should not be established until sound cost and schedule estimates have been developed. Funding and schedule reserves should be provided and managed at the project level. Funds appropriated as 2-year money should be spent as 2-year money. Funds from the first year can be held in reserve and rolled into the second year for immediate spending. This would establish new reserves in current year that can be rolled into the third year, and so on. Overall funding, including reserves, should be consistent with project life-cycle costs, accounting for schedule margins. "
7/1/2004,1523,Aeronautics Research," The final proposal for this effort was approximately 58% higher than government estimates despite the fact that government estimates were derived from X-43A actual costs and were considered to be quite accurate. Do not underestimate the need for thorough project formulation and cost estimation, even when the project appears to be a straightforward follow-on effort.  
      
     ",FALSE," Program should allow adequate schedule for working through the formulation process. This will uncover sources of cost and schedule risk; it may not eliminate them, but the project can at least begin to set stakeholder expectations. Approach the cost estimation effort with the same zeal and require the same breadth of knowledge as one would for a major system design. Project formulation is often the first thing to be sacrificed as funding is allocated, schedule pressures build, and contracts are initiated. "
7/1/2004,1528,Aeronautics Research," Budget errors, omissions, and inconsistencies during formulation, coupled with the need for a focal point to respond to and coordinate with Headquarters Management and Center Chief Financial Office (CFO) personnel. Programs should establish a central resources integration office and baseline the budget as quickly as possible, using a formal mechanism for tracking and approving changes (e.g., NGLT Program Requirements Control Board (PRCB).  
      
     ",FALSE," It is important to establish a central program integration team and business staff as early in the formulation phase as possible. Having a program integration team as a single focal point for Headquarters and the Centers was critical. NGLT utilized a single point of contact for sending all NGLT guideline change requests to Headquarters. This allowed the program integration office to field questions and inquiries from Headquarters and Centers. It also gave the Program Office the ability to handle questions and inquiries from a multitude of sources, thus insulating the project managers from unnecessary actions. "
7/1/2004,1589,Aeronautics Research," A program&raquo;s accomplishments depend on good, open, and integrated communication. The CAIB Report highlighted the issue of keeping a &ldquo;code of silence&rdquo; and its detriment to the success of a program.  
    Programs should consider the &ldquo;Crucial Conversations&rdquo; approach used in NGLT, which effectively deals with organizational cultures that historically encourage silence or retribution.  
      
     ",TRUE," The driving event reinforced the fact that NASA as a whole does not like to hear bad news. Therefore, people fear bringing bad news forward to the Agency. The level of discussion around monthly status reports and the influence of Center management regarding what &ldquo;could be shown to the Program Office&rdquo; was an example of keeping bad news under wraps. Upon further examination, a strategy of &ldquo;containment&rdquo; was discovered that was driven by the overarching theme of &ldquo;image management&rdquo; within NASA.  
     "
7/1/2004,1526,Aeronautics Research," The X-43C Project developed an internal cost effort using X-43A actual cost data and heritage United States Air Force (USAF) engine cost data. Two independent cost estimates were performed that were within 10% of the project estimate. Contract proposal estimates came in more than 50% over these estimates. This created significant problems for NASA and the USAF, ultimately contributing to its cancellation. The Agency should possess the ability to perform credible, independent cost estimates.  
      
     ",FALSE," Inaccurate cost estimates place project and program continuity in peril. Project staffs do not have cost-estimating experience and NASA independent cost estimates are lacking. Contributing factors to poor cost estimates are immature understanding of complex requirements, transition to a full-cost environment, &ldquo;never-been-done-before&rdquo; content and insufficient time for program formulation. Badly under-predicted costs wreak havoc on projects, resulting in slipped schedules, de-scope of content, and, potentially, cancellation. "
7/1/2004,1587,Aeronautics Research," The X-43C Project was required to report up two management chains to the Center level, one for &ldquo;programmatic&rdquo; issues and one for &ldquo;implementation&rdquo; issues.  Projects should report through a single, clear Center management chain.  
      
     ",TRUE," Within a Center, a single management chain is a necessity. Multiple reporting chains within one organization cause confusion, difficulty, and inefficiency in project management.  Multiple management chains result in &ldquo;turf&rdquo; battles, duplication of effort and other distractions for the project staff in status reporting.  
     "
7/1/2004,1524,Aeronautics Research," Due to the creation of NGLT as a merger of two different programs, the Program had not fully achieved one integrated master schedule linking all NGLT projects with standardized schedule formats at the time of Program closing. Programs should clearly identify milestones that all projects need to meet (versus a roll-up of project-level milestones) during formulation.  
      
     ",FALSE, The level of participation by schedulers in all relevant project and program activities limited the NGLT schedule process. 
7/1/2004,1585,Aeronautics Research," SE&amp;A should be executed within technology projects to ensure timely decisions (which are supported with an appropriate depth of analysis e.g., cost/benefit) and coordinated with top-down program-level systems engineering and analysis/requirements flow-down.  
     ",TRUE," For the TBCC Project, detailed contractor analyses/engineering, complemented by parallel NASA studies, proved effective in Project decision-making.  The RS-84 Project continued to use a systems engineering process throughout the life of the Project, continuously questioning and reevaluating previous decisions, since decisions made early in the project may need revision once more information is gathered.  Applying a disciplined systems engineering process helps to manage stress and emotion of the moment to find solutions not evident while working the details.  Good systems engineering practices help identify these details and ensure the overall system works well.

6/21/2004,1480,Aeronautics Research," The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) flight system had the ability to update EDL parameters during Approach, and the mission design furnished an operational plan, process, and tools for performing the updates. These capabilities permitted JPL to respond to new data on the Mars atmospheric density by modifying the timing of the MER parachute release, assuring mission success. Maintain an operational capability to code critical parameters in flight software and to update them during the latter stages of encounter/EDL. ",TRUE, Critical parameters coded in flight software and the ability to alter them within hours of critical events in response to unexpected data on flight characteristics can save a planetary mission or deep space encounter. 
6/6/2004,1478,Aeronautics Research," The Space Shuttle Orbiter Rudder/Speed Brake (R/SB) Actuators on Orbiter OV-103 were disassembled for inspection after 23 years in service. The actuators had been in service for 23 years and had flown 27 missions; they had been certified for 10 years and 100 missions. The inspection revealed corrosion, pitting and wear to varying degrees, and the four R/SB actuators on OV-103 were replaced with the spares, which had themselves been in storage for 17 years. The use of actuators that had been in storage for a longer period than their certified life led to several concerns, which were duly addressed and the spare actuators were cleared for flight. The possibility of other flight hardware being used beyond its certification limits, whether spares or components that had never been replaced, led to issuance of the Lesson Learned documented herein, which cautions against the use of hardware beyond its qualification and certification limits. ",FALSE," ""Programs should periodically review hardware components to ensure that they are operating within qualification and certification limits. Where hardware exceeds those limits, testing or analysis should be performed to properly envelop the actual operating environment."" "
5/17/2004,1485,Aeronautics Research," NASA elected at the end of MER Phase A to build a second Mars Exploration Rover at an estimated cost of $243 million. In addition to potentially doubling science return from Mars and mitigating the program impact were a rover to fail, this &ldquo;two-fer&rdquo; approach proved helpful in controlling development risks. Consider the benefits to system development and I&amp;T that may accrue from building a &ldquo;sister&rdquo; spacecraft and from maintaining multiple testbeds. ",TRUE, The incremental cost of building a second copy of a spacecraft may be exceeded by the value added by the extra risk reduction. 
5/10/2004,1416,Aeronautics Research," Three years after launch, higher-than-normal drag was detected on one of the Cassini reaction wheels. The likely cause was lubricant dispersal after prolonged operation of the RWA at a very slow speed. Treat reaction wheels as a consumable resource, and minimize the time they are operated at very slow speeds. ",FALSE," Maintaining RWAs at absolute zero speed (no motion) during cruise, with periodic exercises every 3 months, is benign. But dwell time inside the low-rpm region may contribute to failure mechanisms such as bearing &ldquo;blocking,&rdquo; cage windup, lubricant dispersal, or lubricant polymerization.  
      
     Operating RWAs in a mode that was not tested, may be viewed as a violation of test-as-you-fly and fly-as you-test. "
5/10/2004,1403,Aeronautics Research," The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) was charted to perform independent technical analyses and evaluations of complex technical issues of Agency programs by using a diverse team of scientists and engineers from across the Agency. This is being accomplished successfully using the One NASA approach. As such, the NESC has become a pathfinder activity for the development of a One NASA organization. Numerous administrative hurdles had to be overcome in establishing the NESC as a true, One NASA organization. Improvements are needed in the areas of personnel records, payroll, benefits, directory services, IT, and property control among others. ",FALSE," The NESC is located at LaRC. A portion of the NESC work force is located at LaRC while other NESC employees are located at their home Centers and report to their NESC supervisors at LaRC. The following issues occurred for NESC employees remaining at their home centers: 

      Medical Records  
      

    
        Employee medical records were transferred to storage or forwarded to LaRC instead of staying at the home Center clinic where the employee is assigned

      IT  
      

    
        Virtual Private Network users cannot access all required resources behind LaRC firewall  
    </ul>
      Travel Manager  
      

    
        All NESC employees ultimately required to have LaRC Travel Manager Account since NESC supervisors at LaRC could not approve travel entered into another Center's Travel Manager system.  

        NESC Chief Engineers at home Centers could not approve travel for non-NESC employees because they cannot have supervisor privileges in their home Center's Travel Manager system. NASA employees outside of the NESC are frequently used on NESC projects.  
    </ul>
      Property Control  
      

    
        Property used by a NESC employee at a home Center stayed under home Center Property Control System. Should be tagged to the NESC. When Property Loan Agreements are required, there is no NESC Supervisor at the respective Centers (all NESC Supervisors reside at LaRC). All future NESC funded equipment will be tagged to LaRC.  
    </ul>
      Badge Requirements/Access to Buildings  
      

    
        Some NESC employees were unable to enter facilities at their home Center due to being hard-lined to LaRC even though they kept their badge from the home Center.  
    </ul>

      Security  
      

    
        Once NESC employees are reassigned to the NESC, their home Center's Office of Security has no record these employees are still civil service employees and are on the Agency's roles.

5/10/2004,1402,Science," Engineering sensors included on board the Spirit and Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers were inadequate to allow an unambiguous physical reconstruction of vehicle performance during the critical entry, descent and landing phase. Suitable sensors to measure pressure, temperature and/or other key variables of the local environment, should be included on future landed missions. ",FALSE," Future planetary missions should include instrumentation to assess entry performance and adequately characterize the environment encountered during entry, descent, and landing. "
5/7/2004,1405,Aeronautics Research, The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) responds to requests from programs/projects to independently analyze complex or difficult problems encompassing a wide range of technical issues and disciplines. The NESC responds with an integrated technical &ldquo;tiger team&rdquo; that includes scientists and engineers from all NASA Centers and industry/academia members as warranted. The NESC has achieved numerous successes to date by institutionalizing the tiger team approach. These diverse and effective tiger teams were made possible by using the One NASA model. ,FALSE," Many scientists, engineers and project managers are not fully aware of what resources are available within the Agency.  
      
     Additionally, experience has shown that scientists and engineers from outside of the program or project can better solve some seemingly intractable technical problems. This &ldquo;fresh look&rdquo; approach is valuable in uncovering issues not found by the original engineering team. Bureaucratic hurdles within the Agency impede development of tiger teams.  
      
     "
5/7/2004,1406,Aeronautics Research," The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) has found that much of the technical data gathered during performance of Independent Technical Assessments is available only as Power Point presentations and not as formal technical reports. Engineering organizations should use reports to document technical results. In addition, emphasis should always be on the content not format, regardless of whether PowerPoint or an engineering report is used for communication. ",FALSE," Much of the technical data collected by the NESC typically comes in the form of Power Point charts that attempt to convey the results of an engineering study. Many times the charts are the only documentation of an engineering study or analysis. Technical data in this format can be plagued with problems of misunderstanding, unintentional misrepresentation and inconsistency as was pointed out in the Columbia Accident Investigation Report (Volume 1 Pg.182, para. 7.3 and pg.191), and confirmed by the NESC experience contained in this Lesson Learned.  
      
    The lack of disciplined, formally documented technical information increases the difficulty of performing an expert independent analysis or evaluation in a timely manner. The data/information can be lost forever if not properly captured at the time of the analysis.  
      
     "
5/7/2004,1404,Science, The existence of Agency-wide standards for work time limits for personnel engaged in critical flight operations has apparently not been widely communicated across NASA. The standards need to be properly promulgated and implemented across all flight programs. ,FALSE, NASA should implement the work time limits for critical operations across the Agency as outlined in NASA Procedural Requirement 1800.1. 
5/7/2004,1407,Aeronautics Research," Performance of data mining and trending analyses of recurring anomalies in NASA programs are difficult due to numerous and dissimilar Problem Reporting and Corrective Action (PRACA) Databases. These databases exist without a common format, classification system or ontology. Agency-wide standards and best practices should be established for PRACA data collection and the associated data taxonomy. ",FALSE," Challenges have been encountered in performing data mining within the Agency for the following reasons:  
     

      
        The Space Shuttle and ISS PRACA databases exist without a common format, classification system or ontology.  

        No single integrated approach to data mining and trending analysis exists.  

        No common standard or requirements for the Agency currently exists.  
      

     Thus, data mining efforts for trending analysis of recurring anomalies have been problematical and protracted, delaying this risk reduction effort. "
4/28/2004,1409,Aeronautics Research," Earned value management (EVM) is a technique used throughout the aerospace industry. An EVM system requires the establishment of a controlled Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) against which cost, schedule, and technical performance can be integrated and assessed. However, it has only been relatively recently that the rigorous methodologies of EVM have been applied to small projects and/or to in-house Government activities. &ldquo;Small&rdquo; projects may be defined as those with a total dollar value of less than $5M, although this is subjective and must be put in the greater context of an individual project and its organizational environment.  
      
    A set of NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) projects with a dollar range from approximately a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars implemented earned value management as part of a pilot initiative. At least a portion of the work was in-house Government activity. The objectives were to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of EVM for projects of that type and size and to determine what obstacles would stand in the way of EVM implementation. The pilot would identify solutions to these obstacles, if possible. The value of the KSC pilot was to collect data in a structured way rather than just relying on defining issues anecdotally.  
      
    While there has been much verbal discussion on the subject, a literature search produced little dealing explicitly with what size of projects to apply EVM. Government policy and related documents have traditionally dictated total contract value dollar thresholds for the application of EVM and state that it is optional below those thresholds. There is often no discussion as to why the thresholds are what they are versus a lower or a higher number.  
      
     ",FALSE," The pilot program demonstrated the difficulty in introducing a new method in an environment that is very dynamic. There are many lessons learned in order to help future endeavors.  
      
    Training:  
      
    Although training was given to all project teams, perhaps the time needed and number of examples presented were not sufficient to explain all facets of the subject matter. Perhaps the time should be lengthened to at least two days from half a day, thus allowing more time for explanation of the concepts and for the students to work sample problems, etc. The curriculum used needs to be clear and organized in a way that is attractive to project managers and shows them the benefits to their work.  
      
    Data Acquisition:  
      
    This probably proved to be one of the biggest obstacles to overcome. Since the NASA financial system was and is undergoing a major change, a lot of data were very difficult to obtain in a format that would support EVM. Project managers spent a lot of time looking for data, collecting data, and trying to reconcile data. There was much manual as opposed to automated effort.  
      
    This portion of the pilot was totally underestimated in terms of difficulty, time spent, and level of frustration, which probably did not aid in project manager acceptance of the EVM process. On the bright side, it clearly identified opportunities for improvement in how data is collected so that it can not only support financial requirements but also project management requirements and above all support the project manager so that he/she can have a good tool to manage the project.  
      
    The bottom line on data is to make sure the financial system supports the kind of data that is needed to fully implement EVM without incurring a high cost in time, effort, or budget to the project.  
      
    Tools:  
      
     Another significant finding was the lack of available off-the-shelf software tools to facilitate conversion of data into an EVM format, although some software does exist. However, they seem more suited for large complex projects. At least in our pilot, project managers expressed the need for a &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; software solution that would not tax the project manager. Our experience showed that the level of frustration with the implementation was related to the amount of manual data input that was necessary or required. For this pilot, we resisted the creation of &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; software to automate the process other than for minor job aids. We did not successfully recreate a large-scale enterprise solution.  
      
    Environment:  
      
     As stated previously, the NASA environment at the time of the pilot was ever changing; not only was the financial system being overhauled, but also the Agency was moving to &ldquo;full cost accounting&rdquo; as well as other significant changes in the way project management was executed. In retrospect, maybe the pilot was asking too much too fast from the project management population. They had to remain focused on delivering the products while working under an ever changing system. Even though the task of the pilot proved to be daunting, in true NASA tradition the project teams gave it their best shot to support the pilot program and provide invaluable data as to the merits of the pilot.

4/27/2004,1492,Aeronautics Research," In November of 2003, the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) performed an Independent Technical Assessment of the Code Y CALIPSO satellite Proteus propulsion bus (ref. NESC Final Report NESC-RP-001, NASA Technical Memorandum number applied for). This is a joint mission with NASA GSFC, LaRC and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Air Force base in April 2005 on a Delta II rocket. There was a high level of confusion among the partners as to what standards, specifications and processes were to be applied (i.e., NASA, French, or DOD). ",FALSE," At the beginning of a project involving outside partners, NASA must clearly define and document its expectations, including the standards, specifications, and processes that should be followed by all parties. The level of NASA insight and influence on non-NASA hardware design, verification and acceptance testing should be documented, clearly communicated, and carried as a project risk to be tracked. "

This is a joint mission with NASA GSFC, LaRC and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Air Force base in April 2005 on a Delta II rocket. There were many interpretations of which specific document dictated the fault tolerance requirements for the spacecraft. Further, given a specific document, there were divergent conclusions over what the fault tolerance verbiage in each document imposed on the spacecraft design, checkout and operations. ",FALSE, Fault tolerance requirements should be clearly defined in appropriate Agency-level design standards and variance accepted only when accompanied by appropriate risk trades and supporting technical rationale. 
4/26/2004,1491,Aeronautics Research," In November of 2003, the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) performed an Independent Technical Assessment of the Code Y CALIPSO satellite Proteus propulsion bus (ref.

This is a joint mission with NASA GSFC, LaRC and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Air Force base in April 2005 on a Delta II rocket. Several personnel safety hazards related to the hydrazine-fueled Proteus propulsion bus could have been minimized or avoided in the design phase. ",FALSE," In the design phase of a project, a thorough risk assessment must be performed to ensure a configuration that provides the overall minimum risk to personnel, the mission, and the environment. While current NASA policy does require a risk assessment, it is important to include all stages of project development when evaluating any potential hazards, including ground processing and integration.

4/15/2004,1482,Aeronautics Research," In a Code T consortium, the work split process was developed over a period of time. This approach often failed to provide the best results for the team. ",FALSE," In dealing with work splits, consortium team management needs to establish guidelines that supports team objectives first and contractor-specific objectives second. Also, to help avoid overruns, consortium managers should be careful of determining work splits based on the amount of labor involved (FTE&raquo;s) rather than funding ($), since the FTE-based estimates are subject to rate increases. Finally, the NASA Project Manager should have some flexibility in reassigning work among consortium members, to ensure the best product for the Government and to provide incentives for the member companies to meet consortium objectives.

4/13/2004,1423,Aeronautics Research," During assembly of the Fluids and Combustion Facility by Northrop Grumman Information Technology at the Glenn Research Center, it was found that numerous aluminum components that were Electroless Nickel Plated to SAE-AMS-C-26074, Class 4, Grade A, by a specific supplier's sub-contractor experienced peeling and flaking. This resulted in significant rework and schedule delays. Due to the defective plating, there is a potential for airborne conductive contaminants thus generating a hazardous condition on the ISS. ",FALSE, It is imperative that all vendors selected to provide space-flight hardware be fully audited to the lowest tier of their sub-contractor supply base to determine their full compliance to all stated standards and requirements. 
4/2/2004,1394,Aeronautics Research," A fast - track engine test was accepted by NASA before its risks and challenges were fully understood, leading to cost overruns and failure to meet original schedules. ",FALSE," Before committing to any project schedule or budget, make sure that all risks and assumptions are fully understood, taken into account, and a consensus or agreement reached with the customer preferably before implementation. "
4/2/2004,1479,Science," The Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE) spacecraft and its instruments were designed and built at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado. SNOE was a small scientific satellite that measured the effects of energy from the sun and from the magnetosphere on the density of nitric oxide in the Earth's upper atmosphere. The SNOE was launched on February 27, 1998 and reentered on December 13, 2003 at 09:34 GMT.  
      
     This document summarizes the lessons learned for the reentry of the SNOE. Even though SNOE was a small spacecraft that had little possibility of impacting the earth, it was an excellent opportunity for SSMO to work through our perceived reentry process. These lessons learned will help to clarify the activities during the reentry of any other NASA mission. Also, recommendations for changes to the NASA Policy Directive (NPD 8710.3A), NASA Policy for Limiting Orbital Debris Generation, will also be suggested.  
      
    Predicting reentry dates is an important task for NASA to maintain public safety. Despite any minimal probability for debris impacting, the mission specific program/project must be aware of all reentry related information including launch vehicles and upper stages.  
    Summary of Lessons Learned:  
      
     ",FALSE," All of the lessons learned form the SNOE reentry are summarized below and are discussed in detail in the following section.  
     

      
        &rdquo;Maintenance&rdquo; of reentry information is not defined in the current version of NPD 8710.3A. Updates to the reentry information are done more on a &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; basis instead of a &ldquo;relative reentry&rdquo; basis.  

        The &ldquo;coordination&rdquo; of reentry information within the agency and &ldquo;notification to appropriate personnel&rdquo; is ambiguous within the NPD.  

        The ""mission specific program/project"" is responsible for implementing the orbital debris mitigation measures and guidelines. To be able to do this effectively the program needs to understand the orbit and reentry characteristics for each mission, and the daily operations and orbit determination activities are an essential input to the reentry predictions. The orbit determination activities are also necessary to plan the daily operational passes. Any &ldquo;program specific"" predictions must be coordinated with Code Q (OSMA).  

        CMOC routinely provides standard orbit data (TLE, etc) to GSFC OIG web site and to JSC. All NASA related reentry information is normally distributed to JSC. Any request for &ldquo;special data&rdquo; needs to be coordinated with CMOC and JSC so as not to cause confusion with the standard data processing.

1/26/2004,1415,Aeronautics Research," On two occasions during the ULYSSES mission, a mission controller erroneously performed a duplicate transmission of an operational command. The problem was traced to imprecise execution of existing command procedures. Four recommendations reinforce the mission operator's charge to ensure that the correct command has been ""loaded"" when it is ""fired off"" to the spacecraft. ",FALSE, It is the responsibility of the mission operator to ensure that the correct command has been &ldquo;loaded&rdquo; when it is &ldquo;fired off&rdquo; to the spacecraft. 
1/12/2004,1390,Aeronautics Research," A mission-critical error was discovered in the communications link between the Cassini spacecraft and its Huygens probe when it was determined that the radio frequencies would not adjust for Doppler effect. This parameter was not isolated during the pre-launch verification process. The recommendations affirm the need for (1) end-to-end testing of communications links, (2) a high fidelity telecommunications testbed, and (3) referencing Doppler effects on subcarriers in an appropriate procedure. ",FALSE,"  
        Despite prior incidents involving Doppler effects on the command subcarriers for Ulysses and Deep Space 1, designers still tend to overlook the subcarrier when analyzing and testing for Doppler effects on deep space communications links.  
        

        It is difficult to conduct realistic simulations of Doppler effect in testbeds that do not replicate communications frequencies and signal levels.  

        Communication link design must be more carefully reviewed and verified by analysis when more than one organization is responsible for verifying through test that the transmitting and receiving spacecraft are compatible under mission conditions.

1/2/2004,1398,Aeronautics Research," Serious damage to an instrument's heater control electronics resulted from incorrect wiring within the interface harness. Efforts to expedite the I&amp;T schedule, incomplete documentation and reduced QA involvement were identified as contributing factors; however, risks were expected to be mitigated by the Safe-to-Mate procedure, which was expected to verify compliance with the ICD. These &ldquo;time saving&rdquo; decisions and acceptance of excess risk resulted not only in damage to the instrument but also a 4-month schedule delay. ",FALSE,"  
        During flight hardware integration, priority and precedence must be given to completion of the electrical power interface Safe-To-Mate procedures. Priority and precedence for testing flight hardware implies that Safe-To-Mate is the first test procedure during integration. No other electrical integration procedures should commence until Safe-To-Mate procedure is completed. Incorrect power interfaces have cause more flight hardware damage than any other electronic hardware failure mode.

    The initial application of power is a continuous process. This process proceeds from component acceptance through flight instrument hardware and systems level integration and test. It cannot be understated the risk associated with the initial application of power to flight hardware. Particularly, when the test configuration is changed from component to subsystem or systems level testing, which involves a change in the power cable and harness interface.   

    <ol start=""2"">
        There is an inherent, and potentially grave, risk with changing existing and established NASA policies and procedures. This is especially true during flight hardware integration, when the intent is to expedite an accelerated schedule. Project management must exercise extreme care and diligence during integration, since there is a significant risk is associated with damaging hardware and/or physical injury.  

        Project systems engineering and quality assurance must be responsible for ensuring the correctness of power interface harness prior to the application of flight hardware power. A system of checks and balances, which verifies flight hardware integration readiness, should be supported by both reviews and audits of power interface harnesses.

1/1/2004,1414,Aeronautics Research," A &ldquo;Fly-off&rdquo; type of procurement using a relatively small Source Evaluation Board (SEB) can minimize the time to assess, award, and implement a contract. However, in order to minimize the Government's risk under this process, the SEB must leverage enough expertise (in &ldquo;ex-official&rdquo; status, if necessary, to fill any knowledge gaps the small SEB might have) to ensure all the Contractor's business practices are adequate and reflect a system that provides sufficient insight/oversight to build the required &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; Government/Contractor relationship after contract award. ",FALSE," In order to use a &ldquo;fly-off&rdquo; type of procurement to minimize the time to assess, award, and implement a contract while ensuring the Government's risk is minimized, the following issues should be considered.  
     

      
        While it can improve efficiency, a small selection team (SEB) may not be adequately effective in assessing all technical and programmatic areas.  

        Any technical or programmatic areas not sufficiently addressed during procurement may increase the Government's risk during contract implementation. This is especially true in instances where an originally selected system design is found to be inadequate and in need of a re-design (in the case of the Project in question, new analytical tools and techniques available after Contract award helped to identify new risks and needed design improvements). While the Government is responsible to identify inadequacies at any and all times during the project life cycle, it must make every effort to completely remove itself from the Contractor's design process. Any participation by the Government in the design undermines the philosophy of placing the risk (via ownership of design) on the Contractor and exposes the Government to a higher level of risk. The Government must be cognizant of this immigration of risk when it elects to participate in a design process, and must balance the risk
      of effectively acquiring ownership of the design against other risks inherent in the situation or migrating to it.  

        Since the procurement's goal is to minimize the time from start to finish, part of it its philosophy is to instill efficiency into the Contractor-Government roles and relationships. Thus, it becomes paramount during the selection process to ensure that the Contractor's processes, procedures, and tools are adequate (as based on some established criteria such as ISO 9001 and/or CMMI) to allow the Government to take a &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; approach during implementation. Also, any criteria to be used to verify/validate and or assess the Contractor's work after contract award must be consistent and compatible with the performance criteria levied on the Contractor.  
      
    The Project successfully addressed these issues with the addition of extra resources (technical experts, analysis tools, schedule, and funding) and the willingness to accept additional development risk via more hands-on involvement in order to reduce the overall risk. In addition, the Project planned its recovery efforts such that they where focused on the product and did not overburden its delivery with force fit or unnecessary processes, i.e. only those processes critical to the products success were developed and employed rather than imposing a conventional process certification/assessment approach. Thus, the Project's approach to compliment the SEB's fly-off approach with real-time adjustments (even against conventional wisdom and/or original intent) based on the increased knowledge that contract implementation brings ensured that the best interests of the Agency where secured.  "
1/1/2004,1412,Aeronautics Research," NSI firing circuit design has not previously taken into account the high probability of plasma shorts and subsequent hard-shorting, as seen during testing on MER, which allowed ground (chassis) return current during pyrotechnic events. Mars Exploration Rover experience has shown that molten NSI fragments can cause a prolonged NSI pin-to-case short that can damage flight hardware. Thirteen design, analysis, inspection, and test recommendations in the areas of Parts Selection and Reliability Analysis, Power/Pyro Design, and System Grounding are offered to account for this possibility. ",TRUE," Plasma arcs from NSI firing can cause a permanent internal pin-to-case short circuit as low as ~ 0 ohms due to deposition of NSI fragments. This failure mechanism can produce current levels that may damage flight hardware, and the likelihood of its occurring appears to be increased by:  
     

    
        Firing the NSI into a mechanical actuation device with a small &ldquo;free&rdquo; volume.  

        High bus voltage system level firing circuit (32.8 V on MER).  

        Firing multiple NSI's within one device. (Conductive gas can flow from one NSI to another within same device.)

Characterize and plan for battery passivation and its effects, and consider designing spacecraft circuitry to tolerate such effects. ",FALSE," Assume that a dormant lithium chemistry spacecraft battery will develop a passivation layer and that the effects on the spacecraft circuitry may be significant: 

    
        Lithium-based spacecraft batteries should be characterized and depassivation measures planned, as required

1/1/2004,1408,Aeronautics Research," The termination phase of a Project's life cycle whether it is implemented early or as scheduled, requires appropriate planning to ensure the Agency's investments (intellectual and real properties) and resources developed during the Project's run are preserved, communicated and returned for Agency benefit. Therefore, it is critical that a termination plan is developed and supported with adequate resources. ",FALSE,"  
        Projects should have a termination plan in place to ensure that the Agency's investment is maximized. This is critical in cases where termination is premature (cases where a Project is ended prior to running its entire planned life-cycle). In particular, the following should be considered and included in the termination plan:

1/1/2004,1425,Aeronautics Research, The success of a project is greatly impacted by the management style of the Project Manager and the manner in which each phase of the Project's life cycle is implemented. ,FALSE," The Project Manager applied many techniques and best practices to the Project including:  
     

      
        Ensuring the efforts, findings, and resources of an investigative board dealing with the failure of a similar system feed into the manufacturing/construction phase of this project.  

        Challenging the project team. The team was challenged to develop a composite based structure that did not have any predecessors. The team took pride and ownership in their innovation.  

        Empowering the project team with the authority to act within their area.  

        Welcoming new staff and bringing them up to speed quickly. The PM mentored or paired up seasoned personnel with new comers to help them acclimatize to the Project.  

        Taking responsibility for things that went wrong and giving credit for things that went right. This owning of responsibility permeated through out the team based on the PM's example and leadership.  

        Integrating everyone into the Project regardless of their experience or technical background. Project members felt they were an integral part of the Project and played a key role in its success. This atmosphere ensured that Project members maintained their enthusiasm and high participation level.  

        Listening and considering each team member's input during meetings and other discussions. The PM created an environment of mutual respect whereby team members respected but debated each other's input and ultimately accepted and supported the group's consensus (sometimes dictated by the PM).  

        Openly communicating his own experience/knowledge gaps to the team. This honesty and openness contributed to the Project's feelings that they were all part of a team and all necessary for its success.

1/1/2004,1424,Aeronautics Research, The success of a project is greatly impacted by the visibility and advocacy within the NASA community. ,FALSE," Lack of project promotion to upper management and inadequate or slow communication of project results can result in an inaccurate appraisal of a project's value to its customers. High visibility and timely communication increase a project's opportunities for recognition and gaining/maintaining support. Low visibility and slow communication may increase a project's vulnerability to budget cuts, milestone de-scoping and a perception that the research results are unimportant or too incremental to merit continued support.

1/1/2004,1421,Aeronautics Research, The training and development of new or inexperienced Project Managers (PM) can be greatly enhanced by pairing them with a Deputy Project Manager (DPM) that is experienced in at least one system wide area (programmatic or technical) such that there is a balance between the management team's applied and academic experience. ,FALSE,"  
        The paring of a seasoned engineer with a minimally experienced PM that recently completed formal management training, created a well-rounded management team for the Project. A seasoned engineer will have extensive knowledge of the engineering processes and an understanding of the challenges unique to the existing Center environment. The newly trained PM will have knowledge and experience with the most current management tools. However, in order for this combination to work, both the PM and DPM must be sensitive and supportive of the other's strengths and weaknesses. All of these factors made for a high-quality working environment.

1/1/2004,1422,Aeronautics Research," Ensuring that a Project's collective wisdom is collected, archived, and disseminated depends on including a schedule, budget, and process for their accomplishment in the Project plan. ",FALSE," If the tasks of collecting, archiving, and disseminating critical Project results/information are not included in the Project plan they will not be accomplished adequately. This is especially true for Projects that are terminated prematurely since this usually results in a relatively quick scattering of Project resources.

1/1/2004,1419,Aeronautics Research, Funding sources under FCA for CofF projects aimed at building or improving unique test facilities must include specific customers in addition to Agency General and Administrative (G&amp;A). ,FALSE," In the Agency's FCA mode CofF projects, especially those aimed at building or improving test facilities can no longer depend exclusively on Agency G&amp;A sources for funding. Rather, funding must be acquired through the projects or activities that will explicitly benefit from their results. Therefore, these funding sources must be identified and acquired during early Project formulation. "
1/1/2004,1420,Aeronautics Research," The success of a project is greatly impacted by the visibility and advocacy within the NASA community, stakeholders, customers, and end users. In addition, an ambiguous project scope can lead to well-meaning changes on behalf of the project team which impact the cost, resources, and schedule to such an extent that the completion of the project may no longer be justified. For projects which cannot be clearly defined from the outset, clear communication between the Project Manager (PM) and the project sponsor is critical in order to receive continued support by the Agency. ",FALSE," The following represents key factors and contributors to the Project's cancellation:  
     

      
        The dependence on funding from Agency institutional budgets, coupled with end users that historically did not pay for the facilities maintenance or infrastructure, did not provide the Project with sufficient resources to operate under full-cost accounting. Once the Agency converted to the FCA system, the Project's &ldquo;non-paying&rdquo; end users did not have the funds to sustain the Project and their advocacy became ineffective.  

        The lack of project promotion to upper management and inadequate or slow communication of project results to stakeholders can result in an inaccurate appraisal of a project's value. This may increase a project's vulnerability to budget cuts, milestone de-scoping and a perception that the research results are unimportant or too incremental to merit continued support.  

        The lack of a comprehensively defined and controlled project scope can result in significant requirements creep and/or excessive modifications. This is especially true when various stakeholders have conflicting requirements. This will make it difficult if not impossible for the Project to estimate and control its budget.  

        The lack of a clear stakeholder hierarchy made it difficult to prioritize their requests and to control the project scope. So while the project was approved by the funding organization with a specific schedule and budget it, continued to accept input from other sources and was no longer able to stay within the approved budget and schedule.

The training content that worked best for the Center's PM community had several characteristics including: local relevance and application, narrow focus, minimal history and theory, and in-class &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; work supported by experienced and credible instructors. The key was to provide training that the students felt confident in and could apply immediately to their work. The factors that contributed the most to the student's training environment addressed issues such as the student's schedule, travel requirements, in-class comfort, attention span, and visual and audio stimulation. The key was to provide a training experience that fostered student participation.

    <ol type=""a"">
        Building a mutually beneficial relationship with the Academy of Program and Project Leadership (APPL) and establishing ARC as &ldquo;APPL West&rdquo; helped bring more courses to ARC and reduced the financial and schedule burden to ARC for training courses.  

        Volunteering ARC to pilot new training and development ideas from APPL provided APPL with valuable feedback and ARC with additional training opportunities and input into the kinds of training resources the Agency would fund.  

        Forming personal relationships helped find personnel within ARC who had an interest in and need for PM training and development. By initially targeting training to this group, the dominant culture of indifference to PM development was circumvented.  
        
      

    <ol start=""2"">
        Establishing credibility for providing interesting, relevant and valuable training and development classes has led to continued and increased interest in PM training and development. Several tactics used to accomplish this were:  
      

    <ol type=""a"">
        Using person to person contact to solicit information on training needs to determine what types of training should be offered. There is an emphasis on offering training that is closely tied to people's current jobs and has immediate applicability. Learning is emphasized rather than certification.  

        Matching training opportunities with members of the community. Specific classes are actively marketed to appropriate personnel through phone calls and targeted email. Course applications are reviewed for appropriateness to ensure personnel will benefit from participation.  

        Continually monitoring courses for usefulness and applicability to the ARC environment. Feedback is collected from participants through course evaluations, phone calls and email. Additionally, having the PMT&amp;D coordinator observe classes in person helps confirm the evaluations through conversations with participants. The feedback is provided to APPL.  

        Emphasizing and offering &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; training whenever possible.  

        Bringing interesting and knowledgeable guest speakers to the Center as another method of providing training. Location and amenities (such as providing refreshments) are considered in making training opportunities attractive.

12/5/2003,1385,Aeronautics Research," The Comet Nucleus Tour, CONTOUR, was designed and built by Johns Hopkins University with specialized support from NASA as a part of NASA's Discovery series of solar system exploration satellites. Launched on July 3, 2002, it was intended to encounter at least two comets to perform a variety of analyses on comet material. However, sometime after the solid rocket motor (SRM) intended to move the satellite out of eccentric earth orbit was fired, the satellite was lost. Mission design did not allow for observation or telemetry coverage during SRM burn, so the mishap investigation board was unable to determine with certainty the cause of the failure. However, a major finding of the investigation was that telemetry or visual coverage of the satellite during SRM burn was, in fact, possible and may help prevent similar mishaps in the future. ",FALSE," I. A major lesson learned was that all spacecraft should retain telemetry or visual contact during critical phases of the mission.  
      
    II. The team felt the mishap may have been driven by certain practices that the team described as more typical of small projects managed by contractor Principal Investigators. These practices include:  
    II-1. Reliance of CONTOUR project on analysis by similarity  
    Although flight history of a selected component is one aspect of acceptance by similarity, it is important to consider whether the application is consistent and within the bounds of previous qualification.  
     II-2. Inadequate systems engineering process and specification of requirements  
    The board cited the fact that few requirements were imposed by NASA regarding the way contractors document or performed work on CONTOUR, creating opportunities for contractors to adopt nonstandard engineering practices.  
     II-3. Inadequate review functions  
    The board felt that inadequate oversight was especially dangerous in combination with nonstandard engineering practices.  
      
     Other observations noted by the team were the lack of telemetry/observation of spacecraft during a critical mission event, a tendency to rely on subcontractors without appropriate insight/oversight, the use of analytic models that were not specific to CONTOUR, a limited understanding of SRM plume heating environments in space, the lack of an orbital debris conjunction plan, and a limited understanding of SRM operating conditions. These are covered in detail in the ""CONTOUR Mishap Investigation Board Report.&rdquo;

Nearly 75% of the SRD requirements were related to S band. The SRD should have focused less on the S band requirements, since the intent of the system was primarily to demonstrate the Ka performance. The S band subsystems utilized standard, proven equipment that were already in use in the GN.  
      
    b. High Data Rate Receiver  
     For bit error rate (BER) testing, it is recommended to use receivers that have been optimized for the data rates under test. Although the unit used during demonstration testing was very flexible and useful for general lab support, the receiver performance in terms of implementation loss at the higher data rates of interest was not adequate to support the objectives of the test. The implementation loss of the test receiver was higher than expected and created difficulties in obtaining useful BER test data. It would also be recommended that a receiver manufacturer take into account the system channel magnitude and phase response to optimally match the receiver filter for best ISI performance.  
      
    c. Boresite Antenna  
     The use of a smaller boresite antenna, or separate antennas for S and Ka band would provide better performance during boresite testing, particularly in high wind situations. For example, a WR-34 horn was used during the latter portion of the demonstration testing, and it provided improved performance compared to the one meter parabolic antenna for this test scenario. It is also recommended to use the same boresite antenna for on-site testing that is used for factory testing. When problems were encountered on-site that did not appear at the factory, the local boresite antenna was blamed for the problems. Using the same boresite antenna would eliminate any finger pointing in a similar situation.  
      
    d. Channel Distortions  
    It is recommended that system requirements be levied on one vender that is responsible for the entire ground terminal design, integration, and test. For example, the magnitude and phase response for the entire channel should be specified from RF input to IF output, and the vendor should perform an allocation of theses end-to-end system requirements to individual components. Distortion measurements through the whole system should be verified at the factory prior to delivery. Also it is recommended that the receiver be mounted close to antenna, and transfer the IF signal in digital format via fiber optic cable rather than at the intermediate frequency. Cable runs should be minimized, and the use very low loss cable is recommended.  
      
    e. Radome  
    The vendor should demonstrate water tightness of radome prior to delivery and installation on-site.  
      
    f. Antenna axis configuration  
    The X-Y axis configuration is the recommended approach for a ground terminal that is required to track low-earth orbiting spacecraft. This configuration precludes the use of a third tilt axis to handle high elevation passes. The X-Y axis system is less complex, improving maintenance and reliability.  
      
    g. Ka Feed components  
    Nearly all problems encountered with the feed were the result of low quality cables and adapters. Recommend in the future that reliability be considered more than cost for the feed subsystem components.

9/1/2003,1397,Science," A Ka-band return infrastructure was implemented for NASA's Space Network under the GSFC Ka-Band Transition Project (KaTP). Throughout the requirements development, design, implementation, and testing activities for this ground terminal, there were a number of events or circumstances that caused lessons to be learned. These events and lesson learned are listed below. ",FALSE,"  
        System Requirements Document (SRD) Development  

      <li style=""list-style: none"">  
        
      
    The SRD development task unnecessarily grew in scope and began to encompass future follow-on work. In addition to Ka-band IF requirements, several versions of the SRD included performance issues related to CCSDS data routing. Considerable time and effort was expended on reviewing documentation that was not pertinent to the task at hand. The SRD should have focused on the function and performance requirements of the Ka-band IF implementation task

        Analysis  
      
    The WSC KaTP team did not originally allocate any labor costs or schedule impacts associated with performing analysis to the waveguide and phase nonlinearity issues. Delays to the KaTP project were incurred while a contractor team was called on to perform additional &ldquo;impact to system performance&rdquo; analysis. An example of this was experienced during the decision on total amounts of phase nonlinearity allowable for the KaTP infrastructure during the Waveguide Equalizer procurement. On a project with the scope, complexity and challenges of the KaTP, the team must consider budgeting additional hours for these unforeseen problems.  

    <ol start=""3"">
        Vendor Delivery  
      
    While the KaTP implementation schedule was aggressive, one could not account for the large delays encountered from the vendors. The contractor team spent considerable time and energy working with the vendor and pushing for delivery. In future large procurements, the contractor team should account for some vendor delays when forecasting schedule and there should be some way of enforcing vendors to deliver hardware on time (either through incentives or penalties incorporated into the contract). The procurement office should have been involved earlier and they may have worked the delivery issues since they control the payments and have more clout with the vendor. Additional time in schedule should be allocated to do more work on vendor surveys and &ldquo;requests for information&rdquo; from prospective vendors. This may have given the KaTP team a better feel for aggressive specifications and alternative architectures. In some cases the team received one vendor quote, which implies
    the specifications may have been too restrictive.  

    <ol start=""4"">
        Equipment Procurement  
      
    The KaTP contractor team has learned to project more time into a schedule to account for RFP technical evaluations, initiating procurements through the CLF, and getting vendors under contract. For large acquisitions, this process can take four to eight weeks.  

    <ol start=""5"">
        Project Budget  
      
    The size and complexity of the KaTP presented several unique challenges. From the onset, NASA project management stated the project had limited funds, however, they wanted to accomplish all of the goals of the project. The KaTP team attempted to achieve a system that met all the requirements with a minimal amount of risk to the project budget and schedule. This approach drove the team to implement an architecture similar to the legacy design and in the future the team should evaluate the critical parameters that impact system performance and choose an architecture that would minimize this risk.   

    <ol start=""6"">
        Waveguide Equalizer Equipment Definition  
      
    The KaTP team focused on an IF frequency Waveguide Equalizer too quickly without weighing other options. This decision was based somewhat on the legacy equipment design using an IF-based equalizer. The team should have explored other possibilities concurrently but the time and effort was not allocated into the schedule.   

    <ol start=""7"">
        225 MHz Downconverter Modifications  
      
    The legacy 225 MHz downconverters were built as custom units and the implementation varied from chassis to chassis. This problem could not have been foreseen, a realistic schedule should allot additional time to handle unforeseen problems.  

    <ol start=""8"">
        Interference with TDRSS Telemetry Signal  
      
    The KaTP team should have contacted the NASA spacecraft engineering group charged with the development of the TDRS- HIJ series spacecraft to determine the rationale for their frequency plan. The spacecraft manufacturer chose to design a specific frequency plan for the TDRS-HIJ series satellites that was not compatible with the SNIP frequency plan. The KaTP team should have researched this issue more thoroughly during the design and implementation of the ground infrastructure.  

    <ol start=""9"">
        SN Demonstration  
      
    The KaTP was hindered during the SN Demonstration tests by test equipment that exhibited higher than expected implementation losses. A considerable amount of time was spent verifying the test equipment, understanding and characterizing the losses inherent in the various test configurations. It is recommended that test receivers should be optimized for the data rate under test. Future testing should incorporate test equipment that meets or exceeds the fidelity one is trying to demonstrate. Suspect test equipment reduces the confidence in the test results and impacts the schedule and budget.  "

        During the investigation, the Board did not adopt a formal policy for use, retention, and archiving of investigation e-mail. Consequently, e-mail was used to transmit CAIB generated investigative materials and analysis. Approximately two months after the investigation began, the General Counsel and DOJ/Aspen began researching NASA and NARA e-mail retention and archival policies for guidance.

The system must fulfill the requirement set identified in the next section. It is equally important to have a designated (hot standby) management team ready to support the myriad of operational requirements and customization needs that one can expect to emerge.

7/20/2003,1384,Aeronautics Research," Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Projects and Resources Online (KPRO) is a KSC software development project to implement a project management information system that meets the unique requirements of NASA. The KPRO team has encountered both good and bad experiences throughout the software development life cycle. These experiences include: Working in direct consultation with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vendors; having a signed agreement when interfacing with external databases; training the target workforce thoroughly for using the developed software; having a management agreement for resources committed to the project; and expending effort to build a cohesive team with proper skills and expertise. These are documented as lessons learned, along with recommendations, and presented as reference for future software development project teams. ",FALSE,"  
        Advantages to KPRO were the direct consultation with Microsoft, participation on the P10 (Microsoft Project 2002) Beta Team, and being a member of the Microsoft Joint Development Program. This gave KSC the ability to counter consult with Microsoft and deliver the initial product earlier than the normal life cycle.  

      <li style=""list-style: none"">  
        

        A signed agreement should be in place before proceeding with implementation of an interface with another database management system. KPRO had a verbal agreement with a NASA counterpart to support an interface between KPRO and a contractor database to provide actual expense data. The KPRO developer proceeded with coding as agreed to verbally. When the verbal agreement was presented in a written format in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the decision was made not to provide the verbally agreed-upon interface. Another method was selected. The developer was required to get an account on the contractor reporting system and develop a report rather than receiving the data electronically per a verbal agreement. It is suspected that the reason for the reversal was that upper management was not informed early-on of the terms of the verbal agreement. The new direction resulted in approximately 4 weeks lost time in implementing a requirement to obtain actual expense data
      for projects in KPRO.  

        The project management workforce should be thoroughly trained and engaged in implementing Agency project management processes before introducing a new tool that adds capabilities in support of the Agency processes. The lack of rigorous project management practices delayed efficient and broad use of the new tool and initially reduced its effectiveness. After emphasizing the processes and offering intensified training on the use of the capabilities of KPRO, there was a noticeable improvement in the project management environment. Project managers managed their projects more efficiently and increased their productivity.  

        The project manager should obtain a commitment to ensure that a dedicated systems engineer is assigned to the project full time during the requirements phase. A systems engineer was assigned to KPRO and attempted to gather KPRO requirements. The individual was spread too thin and pulled off too often to successfully complete his KPRO assignment. This resulted in about 3 months of development time lost while the developers pitched in and assisted the project manager with the requirements document.  

        Building a team with people who work well together and have the proper expertise can make or break a project. KPRO was very fortunate to have formed a small talented, cohesive team to work on the project. The original development team is still intact after more than 2 years. This has been a major factor in the successful implementation of this project management tool at KSC.

     Integration of NGN's many components was a challenge both in terms of the management of the system-to-system interfaces and in the management of lines of authority and reporting for the various organizations involved. One of the methods used to manage this complexity was to charter a quarterly review panel consisting of &ldquo;stake-holder&rdquo; participants with management authority of the various NGN components. The actual ADEOS-II review panel consisted of stake-holder participants from NASA/GSFC Code 450 (ground station and CSOC responsibilities), NASA/GSFC Code 420 (EOS-G Program Office), NASA/GSFC Code 423 (DAACs and networking), NASA/GSFC Code 290 (networks), NOAA/NESDIS (real-time interfaces). Code 300 (quality assurance) also participated as a panel member, and NASA/JPL participated ex officio (SeaWinds management). 

     The ADEOS-II quarterly review panel proved to be very effective in identifying and working-off actions at the management level, and in directing actions to the working level as needed during the late phases of development and testing. The quarterly review panel was declared a success and disbanded after the successful ADEOS-II NGN Operations Readiness Review held in September 2002. "
7/15/2003,1347,Science,,FALSE," Re-Use of Existing Operational Components Lowers Cost and Reduces Risk. These are two of the obvious benefits gained by using operational components in the development and early operations of the NGN. The NGN was able to leverage the considerable investment by NASA in the multi-mission capabilities of the Alaska Synthetic Aperture Radar Faility, the Wallops Flight Facility, CSOC's Data Services Management Center, the EOSDIS Mission Support Network, the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Collectively these organizations provided data capture and Level 0 processing, domestic and international network connectivity, and archive and distribution capabilities. It was determined early in the design concept phase that it would be prohibitively expensive to develop all of the capabilities needed for the ADEOS-II NGN ""from scratch."" The re-use of existing management structures and systems was the obvious solution for a
    cost-effective solution to meet the requirements for NASA's support of ADEOS-II NGN requirements. During the design and early operations phase, all of the NGN component organizations provided the highest caliber of support to the project and program goals.

7/4/2003,1714,Aeronautics Research,"A high performance jet-powered UAV crashed on landing.  A subsequent investigation into the root cause(s) found that the ground support crew did not follow all of the steps in a complex checklist and the pilot did not adhere to the flight parameters dictated by the flight test card.  Omission of pre-flight steps resulted in lower than expected engine thrust performance.  This off-nominal thrust condition caused the pilot to attempt to compensate throughout the flight.  This compensation, along with other complicating factors, caused the pilot to mismanage the UAVs energy, resulting in a landing touchdown speed that was well above rated touchdown speeds, resulting in the collapse of the left main landing gear.  The pilot did not have any previous experience with this UAV.  A primary complicating factor was that the pilot did not know and was not briefed on several key UAV performance factors, primary of which was maximum touchdown speed.  Less than adequate communications between the pilot and ground support crew both in preflight and flight was also a complicating factor.  During the crash, the flight crew was exposed to potential injury since they were situated at the runway edge near the UAV touchdown point.
<br/>
<br/>Execution of each step in a checklist should be independently verified, especially the complex checklists used in these operations.  A pilot briefing on critical vehicle performance parameters should be given even if the pilot is expected to know critical flight parameters.  Communications between pilot and ground support crew should be full and open during preflight and flight.  Real time warnings should be provided to the pilot when deviating from the planned flight test parameters.  The flight crew should maintain a safety barrier device between themselves and the vehicle during the landing sequence.",TRUE,"1.  It was clear that the UAV pilot did not know several key flight critical parameters that a pilot should know in order to execute a flight test.  Chief among them were maximum landing speed and maximum flight time at cruise power.
<br/>
<br/>2.  The ground support crew used a complex preflight checklist and skipped a key step that reduced the thrust time rate-of-change to be less than expected by the pilot, resulting in a longer take off roll, and a re-contact with the runway during departure. 
<br/>
<br/>3.  Steps in checklists maybe missed if the checklist is overly complex.  There was no independent or second check that each step in the preflight checklist was executed.
<br/>
<br/>4.  The preflight checklist did not include a briefing of flight critical parameters to the pilot.  The pilot was new to this UAV.
<br/>
<br/>5.  The pilot&apos;s lack of knowledge in a key area of engine thrust trim contributed to the pilot&apos;s perception of off nominal thrust performance during the flight.
<br/>
<br/>6.  The flight crew did not give the pilot real time warnings when flight critical parameters were being exceeded due to the erroneous assumption that the pilot was familiar with the parameters.
<br/>
<br/>7.  UAV pilots cannot be expected to make the best decisions when operating with incomplete or erroneous knowledge of critical flight parameters.
<br/>
<br/>8.  Flight crews tend to dislike protective barriers between themselves and the UAV, thinking that they can quickly move out of the path of an oncoming UAV during a loss of control incident."
7/1/2003,1496,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program did not have effective relationships with the related programs at all working levels. This could have been resolved by a Memorandum of Understanding between programs.  
      
     ",FALSE," OSP did not have effective relationships with the Launch Services Program (LSP) or International Space Station Program (ISSP) at all working levels. The program partners did not create mutually-beneficial alliances and the agency did not delegate sufficient authority and allocate sufficient resources to the program partners to resolve inter-program issues or establish clear means to reconcile disputes. Additionally:  
      
     a. &ldquo;Top dog&rdquo; - No sole source of authority formally directed all three programs to successfully achieve OSP requirements, and no one held them jointly accountable for creating and operating the caliber of relationship that would have been required for success.  
     b. Memorandum of Understanding - The MOU is a tool for gaining agreement at the program level, yet it is too high of a level of agreement for adequate implementation and resource commitment.  
     c. Launch Services Program (LSP)- No OSP Program representation within LSP existed. OSP prime contractors were not limited by data requests/funding; therefore, they requested significant quantities of data. Validation of launch vehicle provider data was required by NASA-LSP prior to delivery of data to OSP but LSP was not adequately staffed to provide throughout and was overburdened by maintaining multiple vehicles (dual compatibility) within the trade space.  
     d. International Space Station - The roles defined for ISS in OSP requirement development, validation and approval were limited (ISS did not sign OSP system requirements) and did not effectively position ISS with formative, substantive influence on the scope or direction of the OSP.  
     e. Launch Services Program-Integration - The most fundamental questions about who would be responsible for what integration work during Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&amp;E) loomed unresolved. Who would acquire launch services (OSP Prime Contractor? Government furnished services?). Who certified the performance of the integrated ascent configuration's design and readiness for flight, including the system's ability to assure crew survival? Who assured the capability to launch an OSP spacecraft on both Atlas and Delta launch vehicles?  
      
     "
7/1/2003,1497,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) lacked development and planning documents. These documents may have aided the program in proceeding to the next level.  
      
     ",FALSE," OSP planning documents were not sufficiently mature when the decision was made to embark on an accelerated program. Parallel development during program execution deadened the sense of urgency to complete them. Absent these documents, unseen organizational friction and implementation inefficiencies resulted.  
      
     Additionally:  
     a. Program Plan and SEMP The OSP Program Plan, Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) and related foundational plans (Risk Management, Configuration and Data Management, Records Plans, etc.) were not sufficiently mature when the decision was made to embark on an accelerated program. Parallel development during program execution deadened the sense of urgency to complete them  
      
    b. Schedule Planning and Implementation A lack of standardization of inputs from various centers and organizations complicated the Integrated Master Schedule baseline and updates. Additionally, in response to acceleration of the program, two separate schedules of ongoing and planned work were being maintained.  
      
    c. Flight Test Planning Flight test has a major impact on technical, schedule, and budget planning and should be considered in up-front planning. Schedules leading to verification by flight testing need to be assessed for credibility.  
      
     d. Program Shutdown The OSP program ceased abruptly. Some key players were reassigned early, including both managers and administrative personnel thus further complicating the shutdown task. Geographically distant centers relied on web-sites and electronic meeting notices and calendars but, these tools were not updated regularly and then shutdown prior to program's end.

7/1/2003,1511,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program took many proactive management steps to increase our emphasis on safety. Safety must be NASA's highest priority.  
      
     ",FALSE," OSP took many proactive management steps to increase our emphasis on safety. However, just below the surface significant flaws existed in our implementation approach resulting in a misunderstanding of the S&amp;MA organizational authority. With the program acceleration, the quality of the safety products was further compromised by abandoning established requirements, processes, tools, and standards of performance. The intent was to catch up on the safety products at SDR and beyond; however, safety is most effective when woven into the fabric of all organizational elements from the start of a program. 

     Additionally: 

     a. S&amp;MA Leadership. Throughout the life of the program, it appeared that OSP S&amp;MA inclusion in management decisions and leadership was ineffective. A misunderstanding in S&amp;MA leadership was created by the presence of a senior S&amp;MA expert (former S&amp;MA employee) on the Program staff, reporting to the Program Manager. His role was to ensure internal Program implementation of and compliance with S&amp;MA requirements and provide a working level interface with the assigned independent S&amp;MA representatives. It now appears that this arrangement somehow gave the impression of diminishing the role of the separately assigned, independent S&amp;MA representatives. 

     b. De-emphasizing S&amp;MA Products. At the Systems Requirements Review (SRR), S&amp;MA products were de-emphasized as a contract deliverable due to acceleration. These same products were not part of the formal review at the SDR for baselining (only comments were allowed); therefore, these S&amp;MA documents did not go through a thorough review and feedback process. The &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; desired never materialized, and as a result, the normal safety products expected at SDR were deficient. 

     c. S&amp;MA Requirements. Adequate S&amp;MA requirements were not contained in the Level 2 requirements document, and insufficient attention was paid to S&amp;MA data requirements in the contracts. The Program placed so much emphasis on the HRR that we overlooked many, equally important S&amp;MA requirements. 

     d. Level 3 and Level 4 S&amp;MA Requirements Development. Given the inadequate Level 2 S&amp;MA requirements, the Contractors' were unable to develop appropriate Level 3 and 4 S&amp;MA requirements. 

     e. Incomplete Understanding. NASA should not assume the Contractor workforce understands the Government's human space flight expectations. Discipline working groups were needed to provide a forum to assure mutual understanding/interpretation of the S&amp;MA requirements and processes between participating NASA centers, contractors, and related stake holders. Without functioning working groups, the contractors' interpretation and implementation of S&amp;MA requirements were questioned and debated at each program review.

7/1/2003,1509,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program started up the learning curve early by creating the Acquisition Management Office (AMO) specifically for developing the acquisition strategy, Request For Proposal (RFP) development, and Source Evaluation Board (SEB) support. AMO brought our procurement specialists in at the beginning, trained in advanced procurement methods, benchmarked other successes, and included the contractors in the RFP development. Plan how you buy as carefully as what you want to buy  
      
     ",FALSE," NASA generally procures major developments years apart rather than months apart. OSP started up the learning curve early by creating the Acquisition Management Office (AMO) specifically for developing the acquisition strategy, Request For Proposal (RFP) development, and Source Evaluation Board (SEB) support. AMO brought our procurement specialists in at the beginning, trained in advanced procurement methods, benchmarked other successes, and included the contractors in the RFP development. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Contract Modification Burdens. It can take considerable time and resources to modify contracts or create extensions in response to program schedule and budget changes. 

     b. Transition from Development to Operations. During development of the Design and Development RFP, there was much discussion concerning when and how to transition to an operational system to ensure appropriate attention to the transition and to ensure flexibility for the government. 

     c. Acquisition Management Office. OSP started up the acquisition learning curve early by creating the Acquisition Management Office (AMO) specifically for developing the acquisition strategy, building the RFP, and organizing and supporting the SEB. It would have been beneficial for other personnel from the OSP Program to have been part of the training so as to understand how to effectively implement the strategy into the transition to the development phase of the program. 

     d. Acquisition Training. A training regimen was instituted very early in a program's life for acquisition, procurement, and Source Evaluation Boards. This effort should begin with research and benchmarking of NASA and DoD best practices. 

     e. Competitive Contractor Feedback. Government/contractor meetings that involved all bidders were of almost no value, because the contractors would not communicate openly. Conversely, the prospective bidders communicated freely in one-on-one government/contractor sessions, and these sessions were very effective. 

     f. Coalition for Acquisition. RFP development was a successful collaboration of engineers, managers, and procurement specialists from across the country. Co-location was the most efficient setting for efficient document development, but, early involvement through distance collaboration enhanced the co-location meetings. Distance collaboration was implemented using a secure, web-based IT tool &ndash; Projectlink. Contractor participation in RFP development resulted in a quality product where quality is defined as a clear articulation of the work to be contracted by the government and a clear understanding of government intent by the bidders. 

     g. Ongoing Work Leading to Proposal. The OSP program and the SEB worked very hard at creating a linear relationship between the architecture work being conducted and the proposal to be delivered in response to the full scale development RFP. This work was incomplete. The contractors had been reporting at least one design iteration behind in their deliverables as late as SDR. The OSP RFP emphasized contractor performance at SDR. This emphasis may have been in error. "
7/1/2003,1507,Aeronautics Research," Plans, procedures, and policies must be robust enough to withstand the inevitable change in schedules, budgets, and risks. ",FALSE," A stress crack can grow only if the total energy applied increases or remains constant. Acceleration and budget reductions created stress cracks in the OSP management processes. Lack of defined plans and policies kept the energy level steady or climbing. Communication flow suffered, serial processes became parallel, rigor was diminished, record keeping got lax, and training went to the back burner. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Review Criteria. A specific example of stress cracks during the OSP formulation was the lowering of standards/success criteria for major Program reviews, such as SRR and SDR. Meeting the milestones, baselining the requirements, and conducting the meetings became higher priority than the technical content or adequate assessment of the content. 

     b. Shrinking of the Inner Circle. After each occurrence of increased stress (budget cut, schedule accelerated) the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of the Program Management team seemed to shrink and data flow to the mid-level managers and workers was reduced. 

     c. Focus on Operability. Early in the formulation phase, the OSP Program committed to placing a high emphasis on ensuring &ldquo;operability&rdquo; in the design, to reduce life cycle costs and reduce process-induced failures. When pressure was ramping up, the emphasis on operations infusion into the design fell by the wayside. 

     d. Find the &ldquo;NO&rdquo; Point. Ultimately, during times of &ldquo;belt-tightening&rdquo; things will inevitably be given up... but it would be very advantageous to determine in advance (during the calm periods) the real priorities that can not be allowed to degrade under increased schedule, budget, or political pressure. 

     e. Synchronize Development. Requirement development, analyses, and system design activities were not synchronized. Functional decomposition was not complete before system design started and before Level 3 requirements were base-lined. Also, in the environment of acceleration a Requirements Development Team (RDT), consisting of decision makers from the OSP, ELV and ISS Programs and Headquarters, was formed. This team, although very efficient in making decisions and finalizing requirements, also created some undesired consequences. Limited communication to the outside and limited analysis created an environment where some requirements may have lacked technical feasibility. This led to incomplete requirements and orphan or childless level 2 requirements. 

     f. Program Plan and SEMP. The OSP Program Plan, Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) and related foundational plans (Risk Management, Configuration and Data Management, etc.) were not sufficiently mature when the decision was made to embark on an accelerated program. Parallel development during program execution deadened the sense of urgency to complete them. 

     g. Schedule Planning and Implementation. An OSP schedule guidelines document was not prepared early enough in the program execution. A lack of standardization of inputs from various centers and organizations complicated the Integrated Master Schedule baseline and updates. Additionally, in response to acceleration of the program, two separate schedules of ongoing and planned work were being maintained.  
      
     "
7/1/2003,1505,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) had problems defining the proper technical engagement of civil service personnel with contractor teams. In competitive environments, decide, define and communicate up front how NASA participation is to be conducted with the contractors and staff to support that participation.  
      
     ",FALSE," Because of our zeal to protect the competitive environment, OSP had problems defining the proper technical engagement of civil service personnel with contractor teams. In the end, we were getting real traction in the right direction with the participation of our experts in the prime contractors' design efforts. But we started staffing and empowering the engineering expert teams later than we should have, and the early constraints on their participation were too severe.  
      
     Additionally:  
     a. Systems Experts. OSP did not form a standing team of human spaceflight system experts until after the contract data deliverables were defined and many of the government and prime contractor system-level trade studies and requirement development analyses were completed. 

     b. Design Participation. During Competition The single largest start-up obstacle we encountered when trying to get the NASA engineering teams engaged on OSP were the limits on their participation. When the NASA teams were formed, these constraints were not clearly defined or recorded. We wanted to create value-adding design participation relationships with the prime contractors, but we did not want to &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; their ideas with our own. We needed to prevent 'cross-contamination' - revealing one contractor's ideas to another - in order to preserve the integrity of the competitive acquisition. We had to consider whether people who were doing activities like performing government task agreements for delivery to one contractor could be a participant with other contractors, or be assigned to manage a subsystem or discipline area, or be allowed to work on RFP development or proposal evaluation. 

     c. Deliverables - required verses needed. The newly established NASA engineering expert teams found themselves inundated at major program milestone reviews with contractual deliverables that were heavy on paper and light on data. 

     d. Release of Government Data. Concerns about releasing pre-decisional, government-developed data and capabilities limited our participation. OSP's initial policy was not to release any government trade or requirement development analysis data, but finally shared some requirements development rationale data. We eventually recorded very useful guidance shortly before the SDR that allowed the teams to share data unless it potentially implied a government-preferred solution, was proprietary, was pre-decisional or was acquisition sensitive. 

     e. Government Task Agreements (GTA). The OSP program and the prime contractors both benefited from GTAs. However, GTAs create considerable consternation for both parties. The program has little insight to GTA performance and even less authority to manage them. Additionally, the contactor can easily blame the Agency at large for issues involving GTAs. Contractors find it difficult to manage GTAs since at a macro level their customer is also their subcontractor. 

     f. Rules of Engagement. OSP Developed and tested a set of Rules of Engagement by which we participated with two competing contractors equally but separately. 

     g. Data Release Policies. OSP Developed, but did not test, policies for government trade study data release to the two competing contractors. 

     h. Current Competencies New human spaceflight systems are not developed frequently - less often via competitive acquisition. No one does enough human-rated spacecraft development to sustain a current competency, and our contracts and collaboration relationships shouldn't presume that everyone already knows how to do this work well - it was a lesson we learned from the ISS experience. 

     i. Contractor's view of design participation. OSP was not fully aware of the design participation rules of engagement we had established for ourselves. "
7/1/2003,1503,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) systems design activities were impacted as communications became an issue, program-to-program cultures clashed, and internal program integration encountered obstacles and walls. Programs cannot expect to modify other programs and organizations operating culture and processes without, first, agreement, and, second, proper implementation.  
      
     ",FALSE," OSP systems design activities were impacted as communications became an issue, program-to-program cultures clashed, and internal program integration encountered obstacles and walls. OSP achieved a level of collaboration among various centers that may be unprecedented, yet conflicts still remained. 

     Additionally:  
     a. Communication OSP Program forums did not allow for adequate discussion/questions from the implementing team members so that the basis of the marching orders could be readily understood. Questioning of direction, decisions, and policies can strengthen the rationale and buy-in. Additionally, successful implementation of Information Technology (IT) requirements for protection of competition sensitive material, resulted in the inability to quickly and effectively disseminate information to the users. 

     b. Shrinking of the Inner Circle After each occurrence of increased stress (budget cut, schedule accelerated) the &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; of the Program Management team seemed to shrink and data flow to the mid-level managers and workers was reduced.

     ",FALSE," Three major contributors to the dilemma within OSP were (1) a lack of a disciplined, well communicated, Level 1 requirements development process, (2) open or architecture-free Level 2 requirements, and (3) contractor-developed Level 3 requirements (system specification). Rigorous requirements development processes consistent with accepted system engineering practices are critical to establishing a good requirements foundation. The Requirements Development Team (RDT) attempted to insert rigor during the Level 2 requirements development in a short time and with a laser-like focus. But for team members not in the laser's light, the RDT was a blackout. 

     Additionally:  
     a. Communication of Requirements. A requirements philosophy paper was written to help communicate the message. Where it failed was in limited distribution and the lack of diligence to get this message to the personnel involved after the process had started. The use of a small, co-located requirements development team (RDT) also tended to isolate people at different centers as well as the contractors from the discussion behind the requirements. This led to confusion in interpretation of the requirements by the contractors and by the Project Managers who were trying to help the contractors with the interpretation. 

     b. OCD in Parallel. Since the Operations Concept Document (OCD) was developed in parallel with the system requirements the two teams tended to focus on different areas of operation. In some instances the desires of the OCD and the requirements of the SRD were in conflict. 

     c. Multiple Level 2 Documents. Requirements controlled at the program level were contained in a number of documents; the Systems Requirements Document (SRD), the ISS/OSP Interface Requirements Document (IRD), and the Human Rating Plan (HRP). Additional verification requirements were found in the System Verification Plan. Also, some program level requirements were derived from the OCD scenarios and the ELV Interface Design Document (IDD). The locating of Level II requirements in multiple documents did not provide a comprehensive set of Level II system requirements nor provide for consistency of Level III requirements. 

     d. Too much Trade Space. The notion that &ldquo;saying less gives the contractor more freedom&rdquo; isn't entirely true. Having not worked in this environment with NASA previously, the contractors struggled to produce the requirements at Level 3. In all cases the Contractors were looking for much more guidance so they would not go down a path that would lead them to losing out on the Full Scale Development. 

     e. Minimum Standards. A minimum set of standards should have been developed to grade the contractors by and to give them a &ldquo;watermark&rdquo; to go by in the development of level 3 requirements. 

     f. Validation Issues. Validation of the system-level requirements for OSP required the use of the contractor's architecture to show that the requirements can, in fact, be met. Having multiple contractors with different architectures made this a daunting task and, due to limited personnel and time, near impossible. The validation of OSP Level 2 requirements was not adequately resolved. 

     g. Requirements Philosophy. A requirements philosophy paper was written to help communicate the message. 

     h. Level 1 Requirements. The process by which the Level 1 Requirements were developed was not clear to the program implementers. Rationale was not provided for the requirements and the resultant set of requirements was never formally transferred to OSP nor placed under configuration control. It was also indicated that pushback was not allowed. This caused major problems when early government-led trades revealed that the requirements might not be entirely feasible. The ambiguity of the requirements led OSP to create a Level 1 requirements interpretation document and place it under configuration management. However, the OSP requirements development team was not able to communicate directly with the Level 1 requirements developers in order to establish agreement on Level 1 requirements interpretation. Level 2 Requirements Development of the Level 2 requirements did not follow established systems engineering guidelines for allocation, inclusion of performance and functional
    requirements, validation, and feasibility assessments. 

     i. Synchronize Development. Requirement development, analyses, and system design activities were not synchronized. Functional decomposition was not complete before system design started and before Level 3 requirements were base-lined. Also, in the environment of acceleration a Requirements Development Team (RDT), consisting of decision makers from the OSP, Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV) and International Space Station (ISS) Programs and Headquarters, was formed. 

     j. Feasibility Assessment. The process for demonstrating requirements feasibility was unclear. "
7/1/2003,1499,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) failed to quickly charter a strong, centralized technical authority. New programs should establish a systems engineering and integration role with the authority to integrate all program elements.  
      
     ",FALSE," Failure to quickly/clearly charter and mobilize a strong centralized technical authority with responsibility to make binding technical decisions across all elements within OSP and across program boundaries weakened the program's Phase A technical implementation.  
      
     Additionally:  
     a. Systems Engineering and Integration Authority. The Space Launch Initiative (SLI) program was well grounded with a credible, authoritative Systems Engineering and Integration (SEI) organization. SEI was slow to mature in OSP, partially because we thought we knew what we were doing since we had transformed from SLI. 

     b. Unfair Trades. Government facilities cost and operational data is not widely disseminated nor readily accessible; therefore, the contractors did not have the full cost accounting data or insight necessary to perform these trades. NASA strategic planning and facility master planning can/will conflict with trade studies of facilities. 

     c. Trade Studies. The trade studies for smart buyer, requirement feasibility and requirement validation were initially unintegrated.  
      
     "
7/1/2003,1495,Aeronautics Research," Initially, there was no strong link between the VSR&amp;T Project and the SE&amp;A projects. This link was needed to ensure that the proper architectures and, hence, technologies were being addressed. Without the proper linkage to SE&amp;A, the VSR&amp;T Project may not have been addressing the critical technology requirements for the NGLT architectures under consideration. Systems engineering and analysis should be linked to the technology development projects early in the program.  
      
     ",TRUE, A strong linkage between systems analysis and technology development is needed from the start of the program. 
7/1/2003,1489,Science," With the advent of on-orbit reprogrammable remote sensing instruments, the need for high fidelity hardware capable of executing an identical copy of flight software or firmware for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)-based designs to verify and validate flight software changes prior to implementation on orbit has become a necessity. The SAGE III simulator proved itself to be an invaluable tool in expediting instrument development as well as meeting the requirement to verify and validate flight software changes prior to execution during on-orbit operations. ",FALSE," The high-fidelity SAGE III simulator proved itself to be an invaluable tool in expediting instrument development as well as meeting the requirement to verify and validate flight software changes prior to execution during on-orbit operations. Specific lessons learned follow:  
      
     

      
        The SAGE III high-fidelity simulator was used to verify and validate designs prior to committing to a flight hardware build. This approach allowed designers to test their design in a less restrictive environment than required for flight hardware and correct design problems prior to building flight hardware. We believe that this approach saved time and flight hardware rework.  

        The SAGE III high-fidelity simulator facilitated flight software development. SAGE III flight software was developed in parallel with flight hardware using the high fidelity simulator. Significant schedule and costs were saved using this approach because the hardware and software development was a parallel rather than serial activity.  

        Development risk was reduced by testing flight software on engineering hardware rather than flight hardware. This approach avoided the potential situation where critical and high value flight hardware was operated using unproven flight software. The likelihood of damage to critical flight systems by errant software was avoided using this approach.  

        The high fidelity simulator proved to be invaluable during anomaly troubleshooting during integration and test. For instance, the simulator was used to isolate a hardware problem and to develop a software fix for an interface communications problem that occurred infrequently (two-three times) when the instrument was tested at cold temperatures during thermal vacuum testing. This ability allowed the environmental test program to continue in parallel with the anomaly investigation and work-around solution development.  

        The simulator was used to develop, verify, and validate flight software changes during on-orbit operations. The simulator was needed to work around problems with spacecraft provided data (navigation data and attitude data) and other problems with the flight code found during on-orbit operations but not identified during integration and testing.  

        The instrument operations team assumed responsibility for primary flight software sustaining engineering during spacecraft integration. Formal training and &ldquo;behind-the-wheel&rdquo; operation of the simulator was performed to ensure the operations team was capable and ready to perform these functions.  

        Configuration management of the simulator is required. Particular emphasis should be placed on verifying that the ground simulator configuration and software image match the flight configuration to the greatest extent possible.  
      "
7/1/2003,1510,Aeronautics Research," An operational focus was applied by aligning operations equivalent to engineering in the organization and keeping flight, ground, and integrated operations engaged throughout the development. Systems operations must be planned for up front and forced into the design and facilitization.  
      
     ",FALSE," &ldquo;A user will tell you anything you ask about-and nothing more.&rdquo; So, OSP asked many questions, asked early, and asked often. An operational focus was applied by aligning operations equivalent to engineering in the organization and keeping flight, ground, and integrated operations engaged throughout the development. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Integrated Operations. There was recognition that the ground system must be worked in an integrated fashion with the flight system. The operations community was included in the development process from the start and direction was provided by the program manager to optimize the total system versus the vehicle. 

     b. Operators in the Acquisition. Operational conscience extends into SEB membership and all other aspects of the procurement process. The OSP SEB Voting Board members included representatives of the design and operations centers giving a more balanced experience base and perspective in procuring a better system. Committee structure included an Operations Committee with representation from the astronaut corps, the flight controllers from JSC and the ground operations personnel from KSC. 

     c. Focus on Operability. Early in the formulation phase, the OSP Program committed to placing a high emphasis on ensuring &ldquo;operability&rdquo; in the design, to reduce life cycle costs and reduce process-induced failures. When pressure was ramping up, the emphasis on operations infusion into the design fell by the wayside.  
      
     "
7/1/2003,1490,Aeronautics Research, The SAGE III Project had to educate our foreign partners in the area of contamination control. ,FALSE," Expect the Unexpected - Throughout the entire process with the Russian, Ukrainian and Kazakhstan partners, we were subjected to many obstacles, limited resources and knowledge.  
      
     A project must plan to be self-sufficient when working a project in a foreign country. You must provide everything that you think will be needed and then provide for those unexpected situations.  
      
     Supplies for contamination control need to be provided by the US side. It was our experience that Russian provided supplies did not meet the requirements that had been established. This was evident with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and ethyl alcohol, clean room garments, clean room wipes, and general clean room facility conditions. You cannot expect your foreign partners to provide supplies that are equivalent to those used in the US, so don't ask them to provide them.  
      
     The project must also provide contamination control education to the foreign partners so that requirements that have been established can be fully understood and implemented.  
      
     Although the understanding of contamination control and the working conditions in Russia and Kazakhstan were different (and difficult at times) from what the US side was used to, in no way should this be deemed a negative item. The experience of working with people from other countries that have limited resources was rewarding in that they had a strong desire to learn and improve their knowledge and systems.  
      
     We learned from each other in that they (the Russians) are able to do more with less than we could ever consider doing as evidenced by the Mir Space Station. "
7/1/2003,1508,Aeronautics Research," Credibility in cost and schedule estimating is key in convincing stakeholders that a program can execute within resource constraints. Place emphasis on providing credible cost and schedule estimations to stakeholders.  
      
     ",FALSE," Credibility in cost and schedule estimating is key in convincing stakeholders that a program can execute within resource constraints. OSP recognized this issue and placed great emphasis on developing credible cost tools and models that produce credible results. Significant lack of clarity exists in operations cost models for human space flight vehicles. Models were being developed and vetted but more work is required. &ldquo;Smart buyer&rdquo; technical tools and models require a comparable emphasis. Our government evaluators must be able to independently validate contractor's analyses, tools and models. 

     Additionally: 

     a. Human Space Flight Operations Cost Model. Obtaining adequate operations cost estimates was a struggle through-out the OSP program studies. The lack of a cost modeling tool for human flight operations significantly increases the time and effort required to generate costing figures. In addition, it is difficult to provide consistent costing figures through multiple iterations/costing exercises. 

     b. Government Concept. The government concept role in the requirements analysis cycle (RAC) was clear, but its role in the design analysis cycle (DAC) was unclear. 

     c. Design Participation. Teams of NASA human spaceflight system experts and integrated system analysts should have been formed early enough to collaborate on trade study and requirement development analysis design, in order to assure the relevance of objectives and the validity of assumptions, initializing conditions, and models. 

     d. Operations Cost Model. The OSP program recognized the need for a valid Human Space Flight Operations Cost Model to support this and future human space flight programs and had begun development. Operations cost modeling tools are not available. 

     e. OSP Cost Estimating Team. The lack of cost credibility in the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) Program required a fresh approach to providing supportable, defendable, and credible life cycle cost estimates. Assembling and integrating a team of cost estimators with various backgrounds was part of the process to give credibility to OSP cost estimates. 

     f. Independent External Review of NASA Cost Estimating Processes. The lack of cost credibility in the SLI Program required that the government determine, via independent sources, if the best possible cost estimating and analysis practices were being followed on OSP.  
      
     "
7/1/2003,1506,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program technical content and review standards were diluted as the program accelerated and budgets adjusted. Development of a minimum set of NASA-preferred design standards for human space flight systems (flight and ground) will aid design efforts and prevent the requirements creep commonly experienced with gross use of applicable documents.  
      
     ",FALSE," The OSP Program technical content and review standards were diluted as the program accelerated and budgets adjusted. Technical products were compromised by abandoning established processes, tools, and standards of performance. The intent was to catch up later, but the bow wave was growing. OSP implementation was impacted by a lack of shelf-ready standards and specifications for human-rated space flight. Additionally, OSP initially chose not to apply NASA preferred industry and Government standards common to high reliability space flight and ground systems. 

     Additionally:  
     a. Lack of Shelf Ready Specifications. Human-rated space flight is lacking shelf-ready standards and specifications in a number of areas. 

     b. Limit Applicable Documents. Limiting applicable documents to a controlled set will save future development contractors from tailoring applicable documents to what it thinks the government wants. 

     c. Standardized Access to Standards. Once these standards sets are established for future development programs, they need to be organized in a central location, accessible to government and industry alike. "
7/1/2003,1504,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program technical content and review standards were diluted as the program accelerated and budgets adjusted. Altered plans produce altered results. Address technical excellence and the increase in program risk when modifying the program to meet revisions to schedules and budgets.  
      
     ",FALSE," The OSP Program technical content and review standards were diluted as the program accelerated and budgets adjusted. Technical products were compromised by abandoning established processes, tools, and standards of performance. The intent was to catch up later, but the bow wave was growing. 

     Additionally:  
     a. Milestone Review Deliverables OSP milestone review deliverables did not effectively communicate the work performed by the contractors to the reviewers. Contractor requirements traceability matrices did not fully address the issues of requirement rationale and allocation. The number of documents delivered and the lack of clear organization for traceability of requirements hampered the milestone (SRR, SDR) review process. 

     b. Life Cycle Cost (LCC) Estimate Requirements OSP requirements for LCC estimates were not clearly defined. Contractors were asked to minimize LCC, but were constrained by a lack of information on government facilities and government touch labor. Additionally, launch vehicle information was provided at the &ldquo;service&rdquo; level in order to maintain dual vehicle compatibility. 

     c. Synchronize Development Requirement development, analyses, and system design activities were not synchronized. No system design activity was integrating size, weight, volume, surface area, power, cabling, tubing, line layout, acoustic noise, induced environments, maintainability, life-cycle cost, etc. 

     d. Review Integrity The System Requirements Review (SRR) was successfully held according to the schedule, yet a large part of the contractor submitted documentation was 'de-emphasized' by the Program, and there was little or no feedback to the initiators on the comments and Review Item Discrepancies (RIDs) submitted on the documents that were reviewed. Only Program (government) developed documentation was reviewed for the success criteria.  
      
     "
7/1/2003,1502,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) concluded that human ratings requirements required further investigation for implementation. DO NOT under estimate the impact of human rating and crew survival requirements on ALL aspects of a human spaceflight program.  
      
     ",FALSE," The current NASA human ratings requirements (NPR 9705.2, Human Rating Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems) are not yet ""field tested"" by application to development through design or flight certification. OSP learned enough just incorporating them into its requirement baseline to warrant an update to the NASA requirement documents. Recognize that as a combined set, these requirements present program risk, because they have never been fielded into a System design. 

     Additionally:  
      
     a. Launch Vehicle Explosion and Water Survival Failure to incorporate a complete and validated set of crew survival requirements at the beginning of the program led to uncertainty and substantial architectural redesign. Accurate explosion models of the Atlas and Delta launch vehicles do not exist. 

     b. Human Rating of Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV) The ELVs that were to launch the OSP spacecraft were defined to be within the OSP system boundary. For human-rating purposes, the OSP/ELV combinations were to be treated as a single entity with the OSP system and the ELVs were not going to be separately human rated. However, the human rating adequacy of the ELVs was not fully assessed, and it is doubtful that they would have met acceptable human rating requirements. 

     c. Human Rating Plan the plan was available to support the Systems Requirements Review and Systems Design Review and the implications of complying with the Plan could be understood upfront and analysis performed to address competing requirements. 

     d. Lessons from Columbia The OSP SEB proactively used these results of both inputs plus their own independent assessment to assure that the RFP planned for the OSP adequately addressed safety. NASA headquarters Code Q reviewed and concurred in the SEB actions. 

     e. Immature Human Rating Requirements The Human Rating Requirements and Guidelines did not clearly identify the phase of the Program where they were to apply nor was it clear how the requirements could be tailored that did not impart subjectivity in how they were approved.  
      
     "
7/1/2003,1500,Aeronautics Research," The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) had many changes in risk systems, a shortage of risk experts, and ineffective application demoted risk management to a box to be checked. Define the risk management system to be used by the program at program/project onset.  
      
     ",FALSE," Risk Driven Management was intended to be at the center of the Space Launch Initiative (SLI)/OSP modes of operation, equal to the triad of cost, schedule and technical excellence. Many changes in risk systems, a shortage of risk experts, and ineffective application demoted risk management to a box to be checked. 

     Additionally:  
     a. Integrate Risk Management Development of a system that involves multiple programs requires a central collection and control of individual program risks that affect the overall system. OSP did not develop an integrated process for assessing and scoring system risks. Nor was OSP risk management integrated with the Launch Services Program (LSP) or International Space Station (ISS) program risks. Cost, schedule, and technical risks associated with the delivery of launch vehicles and ISS elements were not part of the OSP system risk management process which effectively blurred the overall risk exposure to OSP management. 

     b. Risk Management Tools OSP Risk management tools were not fully deployed; Users were not adequately trained, nor was risk management fully implemented. 

     c. Rules of Engagement-Risk The OSP program's desire for a &ldquo;culture change&rdquo; in how NASA influences contractor designs was not fully communicated to the supporting engineering groups. "
7/1/2003,1498,Aeronautics Research," Orbital Space Plane (OSP) was organized around the people and their home organizations rather than the work to be completed. The organization should design and staff the program according to the work to be completed  
      
     ",FALSE," OSP was staffed with very capable people, yet was organized more around the people and their home organizations rather than around the work to be performed. The program's organizational structure must reflect the capability and the required input and output of each entity. Organizational capabilities and cultural differences must be addressed when establishing working relationship with outside organizations.  
      
     Additionally:  
     a. Center Divisions When faced with infrastructure challenges, historically distributed specialties and most importantly resource allocations the organization split among center organizational boundaries. A primary cause of this concern was the method by which budgets are requested, racked-up, and allocated to centers rather than programs. Our accounting system keeps the divisions strong due to our affinity for center performance metrics and center plans. A strong, program-centric budget methodology with sub-allotment authority may foster better &ldquo;One-NASA&rdquo; operations. 

     b. Systems Engineering Office The Program Systems Engineering, Integration and Operations Office was not viable due to inadequate staffing, unclear roles/responsibilities, inadequate planning, and multiple organizations performing systems engineering functions. An appropriate Systems Engineering and Integration organizational structure should be put in place to cover the integration of the appropriate key engineering disciplines required for implementation of the system engineering process and activities. The Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) should be developed prior to staffing up - to define roles/responsibilities, planning, and technical integration.

1/13/2003,1319,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," During ground testing, a SUBSA Ground Unit Thermal Chamber temperature of about 820 C with qualification Sample Ampoule assemblies (SUBSA-GD1, SUBSA-Q3, and SUBSA-Q4) was sufficient to melt all of the sample charge (approx. 37mm) + about 4mm of the sample's seed. This met the SUBSA Principal Investigator's desire to melt about 2mm into the seed. However, during SUBSA's on-orbit experiment, the flight heater unit temperature of 820 C did not melt into the seed. 

     To melt further into the seed, SUBSA tried to issue a setpoint change command to increase the Thermal Chamber's temperature. The Eurotherm 2408 Controller that controls the Thermal Chamber's temperature would not accept any setpoint change commands above 825 C. Therefore, the SUBSA Thermal Chamber hot zone temperature did not reach the commanded setpoint that is required to achieve the desired science result of melting 2mm into the sample material seed. 

     Overall, the problems experienced with the SUBSA flight hardware and flight software can be directly attributed to programmatic budget and schedule constraints which resulted in inadequate run-time using flight software with flight hardware end items as well as last minute software loads and/or changes to flight software after shipment to KSC for pre-launch processing.

8/25/2002,1310,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Several lessons learned are identified from the subject incident:  
     

      
        
        The excessive amount of propellants accumulated in the chamber was the main contributor to the test failure. This accumulation might have been caused by the unintended time delay in the LOX/RP-1 ignition. Consequently, the eventual ignition led to the chamber over-pressurization. 

        <ol type=""a"">
            Although GOX/GH2 torch igniters have been used in igniting LOX/RP-1 systems, the database and experience of such an igniter for the LOX/RP-1 system are limited. The use of this igniter type for LOX/RP-1 along with its location with respect to the chamber might have caused some delay time in the ignition and created the first two events as stated in the previous section. In this test sequence, LOX was injected to the chamber prior to the RP-1 injection. It has been speculated that RP-1 might have become frozen during this ignition delay. Past data indicates that frozen RP-1/LOX combustion releases an excessive energy creating an over-pressurization in the combustion chamber. Furthermore, due to the nature of the of the vortex chamber flow field, the startup transient is not well understood. For the aforementioned reasons, a better-characterized igniter, such as TEA/TEB, should be applied.  

            To detect the ignition/combustion occurrence, the vortex chamber should be monitored for an increase in pressure. The value of this increase and the detection duration depend on individual test conditions and the chamber configuration. Theoretically, it is possible to estimate these values; however, it is very difficult and tedious to accurately predict them. They are normally determined through initial hot-fire tests, which was also one of the objectives of the fourth test. For this particular test, the test duration was set for 2.00 seconds and the incident occurred at 1.38 seconds within the duration. Given the lack of data, this duration should be set conservatively at a lower value. If the duration does not allow enough time for ignition, a small incremental step can be added to the waiting time. This method, however, may require more tests in order to study the startup conditions.  
          

         &nbsp; 
        

        Historically, most traditional LOX/RP-1 chambers have used an L* (chamber volume/throat ratio) between 35 to 96 inches. The L* for this vortex chamber was approximately 12 inches. It should be mentioned that one of benefits of the vortex chamber concept is to have a small chamber. At the time of the design, this L* value was selected based on an existing Army chamber configuration for a gelled hypergolic propellant system. Later, Army engineers learned that a longer delay in ignition requires a larger chamber volume in order to eliminate the chamber over-pressurization during the startup. From the aforementioned data, a larger L* value should be considered in the final chamber configuration.  

        The Army Vortex test program did not require the IRIG time stamp on the high-speed film . Therefore, it was not active during this series of tests. Normally, the film is only processed in the event of an anamoly. In this incident, the high-speed film provided the best data of what occurred and without the time stamp it required personnel reviewing the film and manually linking the event with the test sequence and data . This method is not as precise as the IRIG method. For the future, the IRIG time stamp should be the standard without the program having to request this option.  

        Normally test articles and facilities are not instrumented for failures. In this case, the thrust measurement system constraints did not allow for close coupling of the facility and test article instrumentation and would have been fine for successful steady state tests. In the future the instrumentation requirements should be more carefully evaluated and where possible instrument for a failure while maintaining the program requirements, schedule and budget.  
      
    In conclusion, the vortex chamber design concept involves flow vortices and combustion behaviors which are not observed in conventional combustion chambers. In addition, existing numerical prediction methods may not be able to accurately predict or describe all startup transients and other phenomenal aspects, including two-phase flow, propellant mixing, flow field characteristics, etc. A conservative approach in the test article design and test planning should be taken to minimize test failure potentials. A gradual change in the hardware design and testing, leading to the eventual optimum configuration, should be considered after experience with the vortex chamber concept is gained.   
      
    Recommendations:  

      
        The vortex chamber configuration, test conditions and test sequence should be improved to minimize propellant accumulation during the ignition process. This may include:  
      

    
        An increase in the chamber volume  

        A reduction of the initial propellant injection flow rate to the chamber  

        No pre-chilling or using gaseous oxygen during the startup to ease the ignition process  

        Shortening the duration of the chamber ignition detection  
        
    </ul>

    <ol start=""2"">
        Other igniter types, such as a TEA/TEB, provide shorter ignition delays and therefore might prove to be better ignition sources. Changes in the igniter location should also be considered to minimize the ignition delay time.  

        Prior to attempting to derive the optimum combustion chamber design, a conservative approach should be taken in the hardware design and test planning. This should help to ensure that experience is gained with the vortex chamber.  

        A time stamp on the high-speed film should become the standard practice where applicable.  

        The instrumentation requirements should be more carefully evaluated and where possible instrument for a failure while maintaining the program requirements, schedule and budget.  

        The Safety Assessment included a Quantity Distance of 160 feet, based on the amount of propellant on the test stand. Fragments from the detonation traveled 480 feet. The Safety Assessment for hot fire testing should include fragmentation predictions for a detonation in the test article. The MSFC Industrial safety Department is working to acquire the necessary expertise and develop procedures for inclusion of fragmentation predictions in the Safety Assessment. This will provide for improved personnel and equipment hazard mitigation techniques.

7/1/2002,1262,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, The pre-test analysis only considered static loads. The mishap investigation team concluded that the nature of the model/mount configuration required a dynamic analysis. 
7/1/2002,1266,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," At a test condition just prior to the mishap (M=0.8, cowl fixed at 9*), a red light indicated that the sting roll moment, which equaled 28,177 in-lbs at the time, exceeded the maximum limit of 26,000 in-lbs. In response to this, the test team decided to limit the maximum cowl angle to 8* so that the roll limit would not be exceeded again. The test data shows that at M=0.8, cowl fixed at 8*, the sting roll moment was 26,487 in-lbs, which slightly exceeds the allowable limit (26,000 in-lbs). No action was taken to this condition.  
      
     The lesson learned was that the test team's response to the limit was not congruent with the nature of the test conditions. At M=0.8, the model was in a region that had not been analyzed. The response to exceeding a load limit should have been to stop testing and analyze the issue in detail. Also, the test team did not monitor a condition that they believed to be safe (i.e., cowl at 8*) close enough to realize that it still exceeded the maximum limit.

7/1/2002,1265,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," As outlined below, relying only on procedures to control an undesired event can result in a catastrophic failure.  
      
     The planned test conditions at the time of the mishap (M = 0.8, move the cowl down to an angle of 8*) had not been properly reviewed and assessed. Data recorded at a test condition just prior to the mishap (M=0.8, cowl fixed at 8*) indicated that these conditions resulted in a sting roll moment (26,487 in-lbs) above the allowable limit (26,000 in-lbs). Also, at M = 0.8, the cowl moved down quicker than expected. This meant the operator response time to activate the cowl's brake was critical. As the cowl moved down, the operator did not activate the brake quick enough to stop the cowl at 8*; consequently, it traveled to its maximum angle of 13*. Note, conditions of M = 0.8, 13* had not been analyzed prior to testing.  
      
     With the cowl at 13*, M = 0.8, the aerodynamic loads resulted in sting loads that exceeded the sting's limits and caused the sting to deflect downward. This deflection decreased the angle of attack by a few degrees (i.e., it became more negative), which increased the aerodynamic forces even more. In other words, excessive aerodynamic forces caused sting deflection that resulted in increasing the already excessive aerodynamic forces. At this point, the aerodynamic forces caused sting loads that far exceeded the sting limits, resulting in ultimate failure of the sting.

        An Indefinite Delivery date/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract which did not commit NASA to buying any particular amount at any particular time but fixed prices and delivery terms up front.  

        Not Separately Priced (NSP) services from the vendor that made them a valuable team player. Examples of NSP services include 3 site visits by knowledgeable engineers employed by the vendor after each purchase to resolve technical issues with purchased hardware; a spreadsheet maintained by the vendor listing part number, serial number and warranty data for all items delivered; guaranteed delivery dates for purchased items; and paper and CD ROM copies of all specifications, databooks, users guides, engineering notes and so forth.

4/11/2002,1428,Aeronautics Research," A mishap has brought to light the importance of properly designed vent, drain, and relief lines. Even though these lines are directly open to the atmosphere, the potential for over pressurization and rupture exists. ",FALSE," At first glance, rupture of the tank appears to be one-fault tolerance - the drain line would have to clog, and the valve would have to leak. But, the high-pressure air, which contained significant amounts of water, enabled on event to cause both conditions. The valve leaked in a manner that resulted in the Joule-Thompson effect. This caused the high-pressure air to be ""throttled"" to a lower pressure and much lower temperature (on the order of -50 F). The lower temperature caused ice to eventually clog the exit of the tank and degrade the mechanical properties of the carbon steel tank material. With the exit clogged, the pressure inside the tank increased until the weakened tank ruptured. "

However, once an upper management decision has been made to change focus or expand goals, it must be supported at every level down the management chain. If not supported in this manner, teamwork will break down, overall mission support will decrease, individuals will lose vision, and success will be further jeopardized. Ensuring accurate information is communicated to all employees (including the Project Manager's support of the changes) minimizes the resistance often demonstrated by groups addressing change. "

1/1/2002,1285,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Programs/projects facing accountability from multiple management entities must have a senior level official who acts as a buffer and control point between the peripheral ""bosses"" and the Program/project. Without this buffer, the Program/project resources will be spread inefficiently and ineffectively and their focus and momentum to deliver customer requirements will be diluted.

1/1/2002,1261,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," As outlined below, failure to properly identify, review and assess worst-case test conditions can result in a chain of events that result in a major mishap.  
      
     The planned test conditions at the time of the mishap (M = 0.8, move the cowl down to an angle of 8*) had not been properly reviewed and assessed. Data recorded at a test condition just prior to the mishap (M=0.8, cowl fixed at 8*) indicated that these conditions resulted in a sting roll moment 26,487 in-lbs, which was above the allowable limit of 26,000 in-lbs. Also, at M = 0.8, the cowl moved down quicker than expected. This meant the operator response time to activate the cowl's brake was critical. As the cowl moved down, the operator did not activate the brake quick enough to stop the cowl at 8*; consequently, it traveled to its maximum angle of 13*. Note, conditions of M = 0.8, 13* had not been analyzed prior to testing.  
      
     With the cowl at 13*, M = 0.8, the aerodynamic loads resulted in sting loads that exceeded the sting's limits and caused the sting to deflect downward. This deflection decreased the angle of attack by a few degrees (i.e., it became more negative), which increased the aerodynamic forces even more. In other words, excessive aerodynamic forces caused sting deflection that resulted in increasing the already excessive aerodynamic forces. At this point, the aerodynamic forces caused sting loads that far exceeded the sting limits, resulting in ultimate failure of the sting.

        Stable Requirements are key to program stability. Do not allow requirements to creep. One step in this process is to involve all stakeholders in developing and finalizing requirements. Stakeholders may include potential development and operations contractors, engineering and other organizations and NASA Headquarters.  

        Plan early in the program for operations considerations, making sure the operations organization is strongly involved in defining requirements and in the early design process to assure systems are user friendly. This is not easy to accomplish for either MSFC or the contractor, particularly in a schedule and funding constrained development environment where design features to enhance operations may result in features not envisioned by the design organization.  

        To the maximum extent possible assure that the operations and verification databases, as well as, command and telemetry pneumonic are common. Often, to reduce cost, a contractor will propose the use of systems level Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) that was previously used on another program. This can make portability between operations and verification difficult, since Ground Support Equipment (GSE) Interface Control Document (ICD) is often obsolete by the time the program is ready for systems testing. Use of existing GSE may require both hardware and software upgrades.  

        The operations organization should realize from the beginning that the development program may suffer schedule erosion, and should therefore develop contingency planning for operations procedure development in an environment where the operations database is not yet finalized. Spending effort complaining about the development program being late is not productive.  

        Spend the necessary resources to provide for a strong systems engineering organization throughout the program. Assign managers for all interface control documents and layout a schedule for their development through baselining. Make sure the systems engineering manager has direct control of all manpower for systems analyses such as thermal, structural dynamics, error budgets, loads, mass properties, electrical power demand, orbital mechanics, etc. Do not overlook the need for strong systems engineering involvement in requirements and verification traceability.  

        Make sure that one organization is responsible for end-to-end systems engineering for the entire payload including the payload ground operations system. Engineering of the entire system includes penetrating the total system design on both sides of an ICD rather than working just your side of it. When responsible for building a total systems analytical model (thermal, structural, dynamic, electrical, etc.) by assembling a number of analytical inputs from other organizations, systematically check the accuracy of these inputs before using them and perform sanity tests on the total model with simple yet carefully chosen boundary conditions to make sure it is correct.  

        When verifying performance of optical elements or systems always cross check the results using another completely different test method. When required to use gravity off-loaders in the test of optical systems, it is essential that they be rigorously tested and correlated with analytical models under both nominal and off nominal conditions.  

        Maintain a strong engineering involvement with the contractor from the beginning of the program, not just when you get into trouble. Encourage a sense of ""ownership"" and continuity of responsibility for all individuals involved in the program. In the case of engineering this can be helped greatly by insuring that the same individual remains responsible for a given technical discipline throughout the program.  

        Assure that adequate funding and schedule reserve is budgeted at the beginning of the program, no less than 25% and possibly more depending on assessed technical risk.  

        Before launch of any remotely operated satellite or other equipment, perform end-to-end tests of the flight system with the ground control system using the final flight and ground versions of hardware, software, database and procedures. The flight operations team should perform these tests. To the extent possible, each command type should be sent and verified. Commands that by their nature cannot be tested in this manner should be tested in a high fidelity simulator with the ground system and all hardware commands to the flight system should be verified using the ground system for functionality.  

        Any mission critical verification that requires verification, in whole or in part, by analysis should be double checked or preferably analyzed in parallel by an independent party. This same principle should also apply to any operational commands that are generated based on analytical input.  

        To the extent that resources permit, design the system with reserve capability, including failure tolerance, beyond that stated in the requirements.  

        Never stop looking for undetected failure modes or potential risks throughout the entire program development and operational phases.  

        Hold regular status meetings by telecon with the entire program team so that all parties remain knowledgeable of program status and issues.  

        NASA management's main goal should be to provide help and guidance to their contractors. Monitoring progress is only a by-product of this effort, not its primary objective.  

        Taking shortcuts in box-level testing is a gamble with poor odds. Spend the time to thoroughly verify the flight worthiness of hardware and software at the lowest level. Finding box-level problems during systems-level testing is much more costly and disruptive in the long run.  

        If independent review teams are to be used, get them involved at Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and keep them involved in all major reviews, as well as in the resolution of critical issues as they arise throughout the program.  

        Critically evaluate any hardware or software that a contractor wants to use from another program or verify by similarity. Independently assess its specifications and how it was used in former programs, as compared with your requirements. Be particularly wary if the previous program was classified and details are not available. Insist that the contractor provide all specifications to support your evaluation.  

        Be especially cautious when dealing with highly complex scientific hardware where the developer is ""the only one that understands how it works."" This system should not be exempt from review by as knowledgeable a team of experts as you can assemble, even if they have to be brought in from another NASA center or independent organizations. For instance, the Advanced Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) CCD radiation test shortcomings may have been caught by such a team, if one had been assembled one early in the program.

        Early on in the investigation there was much concern regarding the lack of damage to the FPB faceplate. Past failures in the FPB injector and OPB injector suggested that faceplate damage was common for fuel flow loss due to contamination. Model analysis performed during this investigation suggests that with a short-duration test and with the fuel cavity contamination type and quantity observed, damage to the FPB faceplate does not necessarily occur. In other words, there exists a substantial range of contamination levels within which it is possible to effectively destroy the HPFTP without melting the FPB faceplate. This conclusion is supported not only by the post-test hardware inspections from this test, but also by mathematical modeling analysis performed by MSFC and Rocketdyne.

6/12/2000,981,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," By nature of their construction, tantalum capacitors (both wet slug and dry slug styles) are polar devices that are susceptible to performance degradation and/or catastrophic failure if reverse biased. This behavioral characteristic has always been known, but recent experiences have reminded us of the importance of proper installation and circuit design when using this type of component. Historically, reverse polarity failures have been observed that resulted from: 

    
        Incorrect initial installation (part installed backwards)  

        Incorrect installation during rework (original part installed correctly, but replacement part put in backwards)  

        Correct circuit design, but incorrect artwork on the printed wiring board (part installed correctly according to the artwork, but actually in backwards)  

        Incorrect circuit design (printed wiring board artwork correct per circuit layout, but design error resulted in parts in backwards)  
    </ul>

     The NASA EEE Parts Assurance Group (NEPAG) is currently investigating the reverse polarity behavior of tantalum dry slug chip capacitors because there is little definitive information in the literature on this subject. Preliminary results will be available in the last quarter of 2001.

     CLR79, CLR81, CLR90 and CLR91 types   

    
        Capable of handling up to 3 volts of reverse polarity regardless of capacitor voltage rating. Leakage current characteristics will be higher than normal.  

        Exceeding 3 volts reverse bias will cause rapid deterioration of the capacitor leading to catastrophic failure (short circuit)  

        Polarity identification is generally indicated by a ""+"" or a stripe on the anode termination. Also, hermetically sealed, tubular case, wet slug styles have a crimp towards one end of the case that may be used to identify the anode (""+"") end. Exceptions or variations to these conventions may exist.  
    </ul>

    <p align=""center"">  Dry Slug (Solid) Tantalum Capacitors  
     Ex. MIL-PRF-39003 and MIL-PRF-55365

        Sensitive to reverse polarity but tend to be much less so than their wet slug counterparts.  

        May fail explosively under reverse bias, even catch fire.  

          May survive ""indefinitely"" at room temperature with up to 15% of their voltage rating applied in reverse.   Capacitors will have a higher leakage current than in the forward direction, but this may be undetectable in the majority of heavily derated circuit applications. The circuit may operate properly for many hours (hundreds or even thousands) before failure. Influential factors in life expectancy are believed to include: manufacturer, style, size, capacitance, moisture content and of course rated voltage.  

        ""Chip"" styles may be more vulnerable to failure under reverse bias than hermetically sealed styles because moisture may accelerate failure. NEPAG is investigating the effect of moisture.  

        
        ""Chip"" styles are more prone to being installed improperly because they may be very small and the polarity identifier can be hard to see. 

        
            Conformally coated ""chip"" styles (ex.--CWR06) typically identify the polarity by a small projection ""nub"" in the center of one termination representing the anode (+) termination  

            Molded case ""chip"" styles (ex.--CWR09 and CWR11) identify the polarity by a beveled edge in the case and/or a polarity bar marked on the case  
        </ul>
        

        Polarity identification is generally indicated by a ""+"" or a stripe adjacent to the anode termination. Exceptions or variations to these conventions may exist. One example of such an exception is the tubular case capacitor made in accordance with MIL-PRF-39003/10 which requires a stripe to identify the cathode ""-"" termination

6/12/2000,980,Science,,FALSE," The approach which the Project undertook was to develop simulators which electrically duplicated the spacecraft side of the interface. These simulators were then shipped to the instruments on a rotating basis. Tests were performed with instrument engineering model hardware and the flight instruments as well. These tests were performed on the flight instruments, after the flight instrument was assembled, but before the lengthy environmental and calibration test phases which complex instruments demand. This gave the instrument developers the confidence that their instrument would be compatible with the spacecraft, when the time came to integrate into the spacecraft. In doing this, it avoided the possibility of having to make a significant instrument modification, as a result of an interface incompatibility, after the instrument had been delivered. This in turn could have resulted in the need for additional regression testing (T/V, EMI/EMC) and the attendant schedule impact. 

     In addition to the benefits of isolating design or workmanship errors in the instrument's spacecraft interface early, it provided an early opportunity for the instrument teams to work in the environment that they would be seeing, after they delivered their instrument to the spacecraft facility. Command and telemetry databases were hosted on the spacecraft interface simulator, and building block procedures, which were to be executed later at spacecraft level, could be debugged at this early opportunity prior to instrument delivery. The planning and information interchange necessitated by the use of this interface simulator hardware caused spacecraft and instrument teams to become cognizant of integration and test issues much sooner than they likely would have. This led to a Terra instrument integration activity which was virtually trouble free. 

     The spacecraft interface simulators deployed during the instrument integration and test phases played an enormous role in the eventual ease of instrument integration. The Terra experience is a strong endorsement for the use of spacecraft simulators at the instrument developers' facility during instrument integration and test. This is particularly true when significant development risk resides on both sides of the interface and the complexity of the instruments is such that a significant amount of time is invested during the instrument environmental test flow.

        The ceramic bed heater is especially vulnerable to excess differential pressure across the bed. Location of the lower pressure port created a single point failure that allowed the differential pressure to develop uncontrolled. Steps which could have been taken to prevent this mishap from occurring could have been more rigorous reviews, identifying the pressure ports in the vessel as safety critical features, listing them as such on the fabrication drawings and in failure modes analyses, and assuring that inspection during construction was accomplished.  

        Formal configuration management should commence immediately following design completion. This configuration management may be tailored to the size and scope of the project. In cases of contracting for hardware or software systems, NASA should participate in or thoroughly audit the Contractors systems to assure adequate configuration controls.  

        The Systems Engineering process, functioning in a project to define and understand all system interfaces, is extremely important. It is even more important for rehabilitation type projects where interfaces between the old and the new systems can become critical.  

        The Trial Run approach of IST for establishing differential pressure settings for safety limits offered no provision for detecting system faults such as the incorrectly located pressure port. It could only have succeeded with a correctly functioning system. The test plan should have provided predicted (calculated) values of differential pressure across the orificed grate as a function of header pressure and valve position.  

        Lines of authority and responsibility must be defined and functioning for a safe and successful ISH process. Project responsibility should extend through the IST process and until the facility is recertified operational and returned to the operating organization.  

        With known high incidence of errors in developmental software, a methodology should be implemented for simulation modeling of systems for software testing prior to putting research facilities at risk. Commercial software systems are available for these purposes.  

        Real time recording and storage of run data for review and diagnostic use is very important whenever attempting the final validation of a control system and its associated software. It is extremely important when using actual system hardware to support the validation process. The more dynamic the system's response to input, the greater the consequences of control system failure.

        Perform comprehensive design review and instrument accordingly for health monitoring. An important goal is to do a comprehensive FMECA by knowledgeable systems engineers or designers, prioritize potential failures based on probability, look at consequences of failure in priority order, and then develop instrumentation and emergency procedures on this basis. This is a difficult task, but when there are many potential single-point failures and the consequences of failure is high, it is worth significant effort. Bearings and fasteners are notorious failure points (even if not highly loaded). They must be monitored, maintained, and replaced accordingly.  

        During design reviews, do not overlook parts designed by contractors even though this may be difficult for proprietary reasons. Because some parts have high safety factors does not mean they all do. In fact, hardware that has been used and modified several times is very likely to have a large variation in safety factors.  

        If control systems are designed to lock up to preclude further inputs, Wind Tunnel Emergency Stop should be the only course of action when lock up occurs.

The most recent failure could have caused personnel injury (The spouting of water and air and the throwing of mud). Therefore, it is the recommendation of the Investigation Panel that the UASF be abandoned and another high pressure air storage facility, if needed, be constructed. The idea of an underground facility should not be rejected because of the recent experience. An underground facility seems attractive from a safety standpoint and, with a properly designed protection system, should be considered with other alternatives in an engineering study.

        Install a venting system, to vent a cluster in case of emergency, to further reduce the release of energy. This vent could be a simple rupture disk that is punctured by a remotely actuated knife.  

        Install an adequate cathodic protection system to slow or arrest the anodic corrosion. The possibility exists of using the test well as the sacrificial anode.

        Critical control system response data, such as the transfer function or inverse transfer functions and calculated drive voltage, must be evaluated real-time during vibration testing, but before application of the sine-burst to ensure that they are reasonable and do not indicate system maladies.  

        A vibration facility validation test should be done for each planned test series that is representative of the actual test conditions before flight or critical hardware is mounted. Use of a simulated mass consistent with that of the test article is always recommended for spacecraft system level testing. Other flight equipment validation testing should be considered based on mass and criticality.  

        Self-checks should be done that provide a representative response for the forcing range of the planned test. For higher force shock tests, shaker systems and test fixtures often do not respond in a linear fashion. It is also foolhardy to assume that test facilities are always in perfect working order.  

        All test requirements should be defined in the test plan for a particular test. The test operators must have adequate data and training to ensure complete verification testing before testing critical hardware.

5/4/2000,916,Aeronautics Research, The MCO project declined further consideration of a fifth trajectory correction maneuver because it had not been adequately tested. Flight projects should review their operational scenarios and mission timelines for consistency with their mission plans and to verify that all planning and testing necessary to support mission risk management decisions has been completed with appropriate management review. ,FALSE,"JPL has referenced this lesson learned as additional rationale and guidance supporting Paragraph 6.1.1 (Mission Design) in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory standard èFlight Project Practices, Rev. 6,è JPL DocID 58032, March 6, 2006, and supporting Paragraph 7.3 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) Scenario Design) in the JPL standard èDesign, Verification/Validation and Operations Principles for Flight Systems (Design Principles),è JPL Document D-17868, Rev. 3, December 11, 2006."""
4/27/2000,886,Aeronautics Research," Although a mission assurance manager was assigned to MCO during project development, there was no independent mission assurance function established for the work performed at JPL following launch. Require an independent Mission Assurance representative during the operational phase of every flight project. This individual should become familiar with and integrated into the project during the latter phases of development, and possess independent responsibility to verify compliance with design and operational requirements.  
     

     Require all flight projects to report and track post-launch anomalies on ISAs. Project management should rigidly enforce this requirement and maintain a disciplined disposition, tracking and resolution process.  
     ",FALSE, See Recommendation(s) 
4/23/2000,979,Science,,FALSE," Several weeks of investigation proceeded, and a significant amount of analysis and modeling were performed. It was determined that the impingement of the thruster plumes from two of the attitude thrusters were producing a large torque, by impinging on the Terra solar array. The Terra solar array is a very large flexible blanket type array. The location of the array during the maneuver resulted in the worse possible orientation for plume interaction, and it also resulted in the largest possible moment arm between the center-of-pressure and center-of-gravity. The combination of these two factors resulted in the larger than expected disturbance torque, which led to the attitude disturbance and the shutdown of the orbit raising maneuver. 

     Subsequent to numerous analyses and simulations, an optimal orientation for the solar array during the maneuvers was determined, and a modified thruster torque transformation matrix were developed. The torque transformation matrix accounted for the residual disturbance which was still induced, even with the solar array in the optmized orientation. 

     A series of smaller orbit raising maneuvers were performed to verify the software changes. The maneuvers executed without problems. Long duration maneuvers were then performed. These maneuvers were likewise successful. Terra reached its operational orbit and began flying in formation with Landsat 7 in February 2000. 

     Upon reviewing the process on why this error was not detected before launch, it was determined that no direct modeling of the plume impingement phenomena was ever performed. Plume effects were accounted for via a design allocation process; however, the torque that was allocated in the design process was inadequate. The allocation was not verified via a closed-loop simulation simulation. 

     This experience reaffirms the value of performing high fidelity 3-axis simulations prior to launch. This is particularly true as spacecraft grow, and surface areas become larger. The utility of high fidelity 3-axis simulations is unquestionable, and should be performed as a routine and continuous part of the spacecraft design process. "
3/25/2000,978,Science,,FALSE," The Terra development schedule had always planned to perform end-to-end testing between the spacecraft and the EOS control center as soon as the ground system was capable of such testing. The initial test between the satellite and the ground system was in fact conducted while the spacecraft was in spacecraft-level thermal/vacuum test. The Terra housekeeping command and control links were exercised, just prior to completion of the Terra thermal/vacuum test. Due to unforeseen problems in the launch vehicle and the ground system, this initial test would prove to be almost two years before the launch of Terra. 

     When the decision was made to change the implementation of the Terra ground system, due to the fact that a number of technical problems were not reaching resolution, the resolve to execute rigorous end-to-end testing became even more critical. A decision was made in the fall of 1998 to incorporate a new control center software package. The software was planned for completion in the spring, with the launch of Terra scheduled for the summer. 

     Schedule pressures could have forced a lesser amount of allocated time for end-to-end testing, however the Project adopted the philosophy that no rigor be compromised, and a comprehensive test flow was adopted. Where early testing was possible with preliminary deliveries of the ground software, the philosophy was to always regression test when a subsequent software delivery became available. 

     The spacecraft and ground teams performed tremendously in spite of difficult and challenging circumstances. Both S-band and Ku-band tests were executed, using the NASA Compatibility Test Van (CTV) which had been shipped to the launch site for this very purpose. The early orbit mission activities were tested and retested, validating the hardware, software, and perhaps most importantly the people. 

     The lesson learned from the success of Terra's early communications success, is that there is no substitute for real life end-to-end testing. In Terra's unique circumstances, it placed a tremendous demand on the spacecraft and ground systems personnel who had to complete the software development, launch preparations and end-to-end testing on a compressed schedule. All who were involved with Terra will agree that there should be no compromise when it comes to such critical tests between the flight and ground segments. "
3/24/2000,1084,Science," The primary cause of this Central Power Plant (CPP) pressurized steam line incident was that no one took responsibility for coordinating all aspects of executing the outage. 

     Recommendations included revising procedures, conducting an independent safety audit of the CPP, Developing as-built drawings for the CPP, and establishing &ldquo;Locked And Tagged Out&rdquo; processes and requirements. ",FALSE," The primary cause of the pressurized steam line incident was that no one took responsibility for coordinating all aspects of executing the outage. Each group involved in the outage focused on what they believed to be their role and did not concern themselves with what the other groups were doing. Consequently, issues that required a coordinated effort such as blowing down the de-energized lines or informing the contractor when it was safe to commence work were not adequately addressed. The MIB believes that if one person/organization had coordinated the entire job, the contractors would not have started jack-hammering before the steam line was de-energized. A second primary cause of this incident is that is that no procedures exist for shutting down the north High Pressure Steam (HPS) line in the CPP and no prior planning occurred. Workers had to trace the steam line the day of the outage to determine what valves to close. Their efforts were hindered by such contributing causes
    as unlabeled valves, no visual pressure indicators on the line, inadequate access to the valves and a leaking valve. This resulted in the line not being completely de-energized until after the contractors had completed their shift for the day. Corrective Action Plans from past mishap investigations must be implemented in a timely manner and the actions sustained over time. 

     No clearly identified leader to coordinate all aspects of a task involving multiple organizations can result in a failure to communicate safety-critical information that could prevent a mishap. Such tasks should have a clearly identified leader who has the responsibility of coordinating all aspects of the job and communicating safety-critical information to all personnel involved in the task. 

     Outdated or inaccurate facility drawings/documentation and poor labeling of a facility such as the CPP increases the difficulty of accomplishing tasks of all levels of complexity and therefore increases the likelihood of errors and mistakes that could result in a mishap. Accurate and up-to-date drawings/documentation and clear labeling of such facilities on the other hand, assist workers in understanding the detailed design and operations of the facilities and therefore minimize the likelihood or errors and mistakes. 

     Division safety guidance documents should be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect changes in NASA/GSFC safety policies, organizational structure or evolved ways of doing business. "
3/24/2000,1085,Science," An attendant left workers unattended in an electrical manhole, suggesting a lax attitude towards confined space guidelines. 

     Improve training, audit, and onsite management of high voltage electrician employees. ",FALSE," The primary cause of the electrical manhole incident is an error in judgment made by the attendant that left the workers in the manhole unattended. The Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) identified two contributing causes. Testimony indicated that non-adherence to the Code 220 confined space guidelines was the norm in this organization at the time of this incident. This mode of operation was either condoned by or unknown to management. All workers involved in the incident had received some confined space training; however records indicated that it was not complete or recent. The attendant had not received training while a GSFC employee. The MIB believes that inadequate training contributed to the relaxed attitude of employees towards adherence to the confined space entry guidelines, which in turn contributed to the attendant's decision. 

     A lax attitude towards safety has a cumulative effect: Lapses in OSHA-required training leads to non-adherence to important safety-related practices and to employees that do not have safety upper most in their minds. New employees get the impression that safety is not all that important. Lapses in adhering to safety requirements and/or enforcement of adhering to safety requirements leads to the perception that the rules are not based on a real need to prevent mishaps (i,.e., we never follow the rules and nothing bad happens). Eventually, these lapses will result in a mishap. "
3/24/2000,1086,Science," The incidents described in Lessons Learned #1084 and #1085 suggest a lack of awareness of what constitutes a close call and the fact that close calls should be reported into the NASA Mishap Reporting System. 

     The lesson recommendations include a number of steps to provide more specific safety guidance, including definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;close call.&rdquo;  
     ",FALSE," The primary cause of the lack of close call reporting of these incidents was a lack of awareness of what constitutes a close call and the fact that close calls should be reported into the NASA Mishap Reporting System via the 1627 Form. Personnel involved in the pressurized steam line incident were unaware that the 1627 Form should have been submitted. The delayed submittal of this form was due to the pending appointment of the MIB. Personnel involved in the electrical manhole incident did not believe it was a close call. The MIB identified two significant contributing causes to these perceptions. The Code 220, Code 227 and NASA level guidance documents on close call/mishap reporting as well as the mishap Form 1627 itself focus on mishaps. Most of the guidance provided is mishap-specific such as attending to the injured and securing the scene, things that do not typically exist in close calls. While Code 220 and 227 guidance do require close call reporting, testimony indicated
    that it had become common practice to address close calls as an internal issue (in the branch/section in which they occurred) and not pass the information up the management chain or to the GSFC Safety and Environmental Branch. 

     Corrective actions were developed for both of these close call incidents. However, in the pressurized steam line incident the corrective actions were not adequate to prevent recurrence since they did not address the root causes of the incident. 

     Employees cannot follow policies they are not aware of or are not clear. Even though NASA policies do require the reporting of close calls into the NASA mishap reporting system, if that information is not passed on to all employees in an easily understood and visible manner it will not be followed. 

     Resolution of close calls is best accomplished through close cooperation between the organization in which the close call occurred and the Center's safety organization. Each organization brings unique knowledge skills and abilities to the table that can be used to determine what went wrong and what can be done to prevent recurrence. 

     If close calls are not investigated and addressed in a timely manner, the possible benefits derived from them (i.e., preventing mishaps caused by similar events) are lost. 

     Lack of Knowledge of What Constitutes a Close Call: In both the Pressurized Steam Line and Electrical Manhole close calls, a general lack of knowledge of the definition of what constitutes a close call was evident. Witnesses testified in both cases that they did not consider the incidents close calls. In the Steam line case, the Mechanical Maintenance Shop (MMS) worker did consider it a close call and did report it to his supervisor (as required) and the Safety and Environmental Branch (Code 205.2). The MMS supervisor informed the General Foreman and he brought the MMS and CPP groups together to solve the issue. They were not aware that a close call should be reported on a NASA Mishap Reporting Form (1627 Form). The MMS workers expected Code 205.2 to investigate and assist in resolving the issue. Code 205.2 expected Code 220 to file the 1627 Form and take action to resolve the issue. When the 1627 Form was filled out 2 months later it appears to have been done without the
    information originally provided to Code 205.2 by the MMS worker. In the Electrical manhole incident, the supervisor did not consider the incident a close call and therefore did not consider taking any official action. 

     Discussion of Close Call Reporting In Guidance Documents: The MIB reviewed the following documents to determine if they provided adequate instructions on how to handle close calls: A) Code 227 Safety Manual, Reference E; B) GSFC Facilities Management Division (Code 220) Safety and Health Program Plan (S&amp;HPP), Reference F; C) NPD 862 1.1.G, NASA Mishap Reporting and Investigating Policy, Reference A; and D) NHB; 1700.1 (-VI-B), NASA Safety Policy and Requirements Document, Reference B. 

     In general, the documents coverage of close calls is sparse. Close calls are identified as being one of the types of incidents covered, however, the majority of the guidance focuses heavily on aspects of mishaps that are not part of close calls (i.e., injuries, emergency situations). Discussion of close call reporting in the Code 227 Safety Manual is particularly unclear. A close call or near miss is not separately defined but is included as part of an incident definition. The steps to be taken by personnel involved in incidents and their supervisors focus on mishaps. This could lead readers to believe that close calls are not included in reporting policies. The Code 220 S&amp;HPP's discussion of close calls is nearly identical to that included in NPD 8621.1G and NHB 1700.1 (VI-B). All of these documents specify that close calls are to be included in reporting policies and on the 1627 Form. 

     Mishap Reporting Form: The NASA Mishap Report form (1627 Form) is also geared primarily towards mishaps. The only indication that the form is also used for reporting close calls is one box to be checked. The rest of the form is focused on reporting injuries and equipment damage, items not normally a part of close calls. The form design could mislead employees into believing that it is not for close calls, only mishaps. 

     GSFC Close Call Hazard Reporting System: During the course of interviews the Board asked witnesses about their knowledge of the new GSFC Close Call Hazard Reporting System. Most witnesses were aware of the new system and felt it to be easier to use than the 1627 form for close call reporting. The MIB concurs with this assessment. 

     Fear of Reprisals: Several Witnesses expressed an unwillingness to report close calls due to the fear of reprisals. Contractors were concerned with losing future contracts if they reported civil servants caused close calls. Even if contractors did it anonymously, they feared that it could still be ascertained who submitted the report. Note these 2 incidents the MIB investigated were submitted anonymously through the NSRS system but several witnesses were convinced they knew who the submitter was, and their guesses were different. Therefore, even anonymous submittals may have a negative impact on the submitter (or on those thought to be the submitter). 

     Lack of Corrective Actions Development: The MIB found that corrective actions were developed in both incidents commensurate: with the supervisor's perception of the incident and its level of severity. In the pressurized steam line incident, the corrective actions listed on the mishap report form were not adequate to address the incident. The actions called for the development of a Standard Operating Procedure for face-to-face meetings between Mechanical Maintenance Shop (MMS) and Central Power Plant (CPP) personnel when outages involve both shops, the incorporation of that procedure into the branch safety manual and refresher training for all personnel in lock out/tag out procedures. Face-to-face meetings did occur the day of the incident and did not prevent it. While lock out/tag out was not done correctly during the incident, that fact did not contribute to the failure to inform the contractor that the lines were not secured or the failure to secure the lines in a timely
    manner. In addition, the MIB could find no evidence that the corrective actions had been completed. In the electrical manhole incident the corrective actions were appropriate. "

        The key lesson here is not a new one. Ground testing should be done in the same configuration in which you will fly. The normal on-orbit operating mode for AMSU-B is scanning. However, during much of the spacecraft level EMI/EMC testing on the NOAA-K spacecraft, the AMSU-B instrument was tested in a non-scanning mode due to a ground test, antenna bearing operating time restriction. Even though there were restrictions on the ground operating time of the instrument in the scan mode, more time could have been allocated for EMI/EMC system level testing. It is important to test all flight hardware in as near flight conditions as possible to avoid on-orbit surprises.  

        The second lesson here is to carefully and thoroughly review all of your test data. In reviewing the spacecraft level EMI/EMC data again after the flight anomaly was noted, it was discovered that during the times the instrument was scanning, interference was visible in the data. The instrument was also tested by itself before delivery to the spacecraft and interference should have been detected there also.  

        The third lesson is that in the design of space flight hardware, care must be taken to assure that whenever possible, hardware can be adequately tested on the ground before launch. In the case of AMSU-B, the manufacturer of the instrument was concerned that bearing lubricant would degrade through oxidation while operating at ambient pressure. They therefore imposed a ground test operating time limit on the instrument. Other lubricants and/or designs were available that would have eliminated this constraint.

     This lesson contains major findings from a 1999 review of the Mars Climate Observer (MCO) mishap report to gather ""lessons learned"" which might be applied to help the ProSEDS project team assure mission success. All MCO contributing causes &amp; corrective actions were reviewed and a list of ""lessons"" was developed to help assure ProSEDS mission success.

        Inconsistent use of English versus metric units can have a disastrous impact.  

        Project managers must assure that mission operations &amp; data analysis personnel, often excluded from engineering and design reviews, have an adequate understanding of the system's critical performance characteristics so that operational personnel can make better ""real-time"" decisions during mission ops.  

        Systems engineering must be done to assure adequate transition from development to operations and to assure proper flow of information between engineering/navigation and operations personnel.  

        Unless a formal method of documenting ""concerns"" exists and is available to all disciplines, concerns can continue to ""slip through the cracks.""  

        Assure adequate staffing to support critical operations.

12/1/1999,664,Science,,FALSE," The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. 

     The Board finds that the loss of the SOHO spacecraft was a direct result of operational errors, a failure to adequately monitor spacecraft status, and an erroneous decision which disabled part of the on-board autonomous failure detection. Further, following the occurrence of the emergency situation, the Board finds that insufficient time was taken by the operations team to fully assess the spacecraft status prior to initiating recovery operations. The Board discovered that a number of factors contributed to the circumstances that allowed the direct causes to occur. 

      FACTORS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSS</u> 

     The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. 

     The first two errors were contained in predefined command sequences executed from the Ground System, while the last error was a decision to send a command to the spacecraft in response to unexpected telemetry. The sequence of these errors and their relationship to the triggered-ESRs are graphically depicted in Diagram 1.

     This series of events was preceded by a routine calibration of the spacecraft's three roll gyros. As stated earlier, the gyros are not required during most of the mission. They are used for thruster-based activities such as momentum management, ISA, and ESR. 

     Since the gyro calibration in the compressed timeline is immediately followed by the execution of momentum management, the previously employed procedure to despin the gyros at the end of the gyro calibration and to re-enable the on-board software gyro control function was not required. Following gyro calibration, Gyro A was specifically deactivated (despun) in order to conserve its life, while Gyros B and C remained fully active. Due to an omission in the modified predefined command sequence actually used, the onboard software function that activates the gyro needed by ESR was not enabled. This omission resulted in the removal of the functionality of the normal safe mode and ultimately caused the catastrophic sequence of events. 

     Following the momentum management maneuver, Gyro B, which is used for fault detection, was erroneously left in its high gain setting, resulting in an indicated roll rate of 20 times greater than actual. The incorrect gain was due to an error in another predefined command sequence; this error resulted in an on-board fault detection output that triggered an ESR. This ESR, the 5th since launch, occurred at 7:16 PM EDT (23:16 UT), June 24, 1998. 

     During ESR-5, the control Gyro A was not active because of the first error referenced above; however, there is no evidence or belief that any anomalous spacecraft behavior had occurred. As per design, the ESR event resulted in a reconfiguration of the gyros. Gyro A replaced Gyro C as the roll gyro used for the ESR thruster-based control mode, while Gyro B remained configured as the fault detection gyro. The error in Gyro B's gain was discovered and corrected, but the Gyro A despun status was not identified. 

     After transitioning to the ISA mode as part of the normal ESR recovery sequence, the attitude control system began integrating the gyro drift rate bias associated with the still despun Gyro A. After 15 minutes, this resulted in roll thruster firings intended to null the apparent (but non-existent) roll attitude error. In less than one minute, the roll rate was sufficiently high to trigger the Gyro B based fault detection once again, resulting in ESR-6 at 10:35 PM EDT (02:35 UT), June 24, 1998. 

     Although the spacecraft remained Sun-pointing within nominal limits and was therefore in a power-positive and thermally-safe attitude, the state of the spacecraft was precarious at this point in time. It had an anomalous roll rate and was depending on a deactivated gyro for roll control in both ESR and ISA modes. The personnel on the ground were not aware of either of these facts at that time. Gyro C was correctly configured to the ACU since the reconfiguration at ESR-5. Gyro B was active and on-line for fault detection, and it was correctly measuring the anomalous roll rate. A rapid decision was made that Gyro B was faulty because its output disagreed with the rate indicated by Gyro A. This decision led to the commanding off of Gyro B. 

     During ESR-6 recovery, Ground Operations commanded the spacecraft to ISA mode. In ISA, the attitude control system resumed firing roll thrusters in an attempt to null the attitude error associated with the electrical rate bias term of the despun Gyro A. Gyro B and the associated fault detection were now inactive. The increasing roll rate eventually resulted in pitch and yaw Sun-pointing errors that exceeded a prescribed limit of five degrees, resulting in ESR-7 at 12:38 AM EDT (04:38 UT), June 25, 1998. Due to the gyroscopic cross-coupling torques caused by pitch and yaw thruster firings, and the absence of true roll rate indications, the ESR controller was no longer stable, and the spacecraft attitude diverged. The incorrect diagnosis of a Gyro B fault and the subsequent ground response to this diagnosis ultimately resulted in loss of attitude control, subsequent loss of telemetry, and loss of power and thermal control. Loss of telemetry occurred at 12:43:56 AM EDT (04:43:56
    UT), June 25, 1998. It can not be determined whether this loss was a consequence of insufficient power or a loss of communication link caused by spacecraft attitude. 

     At any time during the over five hour emergency situation, the verification of the spinning status of Gyro A would have precluded the mishap. 

     For further information, a more detailed timeline summarizing the sequence of events leading up to the mishap is provided in Appendix C. A detailed fault tree analysis supporting the above scenario and the Board's conclusions has been performed by MMS and is on file.

12/1/1999,641,Science,,FALSE," The MCO Mishap Investigation board (MIB) has determined that the root cause for the loss of the MCO spacecraft was the failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file, ""Small Forces,"" used in trajectory models. Specifically, thruster performance data in English units instead of metric units was used in the software application code titled SM_FORCES (small forces). A file called Angular Momentum Desaturation (AMD) contained the output data from the SM_FORCES software. The data in the AMD file was required to be in metric units per existing software interface documentation, and the trajectory modelers assumed the data was provided in metric units per the requirements. 

     During the 9-month journey from Earth to Mars, propulsion maneuvers were periodically performed to remove angular momentum buildup in the on-board reaction wheels (flywheels). These Angular Momentum Desaturation (AMD) events occurred 10-14 times more often than was expected by the operations navigation team. This was because the MCO solar array was asymmetrical relative to the spacecraft body as compared to Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) which had symmetrical solar arrays. This asymmetric effect significantly increased the Sun-induced (solar pressure-induced) momentum buildup on the spacecraft. The increased AMD events coupled with the fact that the angular momentum (impulse) data was in English, rather than metric, units, resulted in small errors being introduced in the trajectory estimate over the course of the 9-month journey. At the time of Mars insertion, the spacecraft trajectory was approximately 170 kilometers lower than planned. As a result, MCO either was destroyed in the
    atmosphere or re-entered heliocentric space after leaving Mars' atmosphere. 

     The Board recognizes that mistakes occur on spacecraft projects. However, sufficient processes are usually in place on projects to catch these mistakes before they become critical to mission success. Unfortunately for MCO, the root cause was not caught by the processes in-place in the MCO project.

        When inspecting semi-rigid cables after vibration testing, use a magnifying glass with very good lighting, and look very carefully for cracks.
       

       
          During thermal vacuum testing of semi-rigid cables, carefully monitor RF output signals for signs of signal drift that may indicate a cracked cable. Consider conducting several thermal cycles to increase the likelihood of crack detection.
        

        
        Testing of PFMs may permit only in-situ visual examination of components, while STM tests typically allow cables to be removed from the unit for close examination.
        

        
        Where funding and schedule permits, structures joined by semi-rigid cables should be tested in a developmental model, such as an STM, that facilitates cable removal and inspection.
        

        
        After a cable assembly passes environmental test, a second ""identical"" cable may fail due to minor differences in manufacture and installation.
        

        
         To the extent feasible, cable receiving inspection, assembly, and installation should be standardized so that test results on one cable are valid on subsequent articles.

4/9/1999,619,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The ACE project approach was to stick to design where ""good is good enough"" and not allow hardware changes just for the sake of ""improvement"". A reasonable schedule with key milestones was established with heavy emphasis on maintaining it. The ability to reallocate funds as needed was crucial to keeping the mission on target. The management arrangement was innovative and resulted in a 3-way nexus of centers, the GSFC for project management, the California Institute of Technology (CIT) for the payload development and the Johns Hopkins University JHU Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) for the spacecraft development. Each center had enough power and independence that aided in reaching solutions and working out difficult situations. 

     Specific techniques used during the execution of ACE included: 

      
        Maintain full and open communications with all project peers in up, down and sideways directions. Foster team approaches by being open, honest and frank in discussions with team members.  

        Place heavy emphasis on schedule maintenance and design to cost.  

        Delegate development responsibility in order to facilitate effective results and maximize resources. Provide adequate reserves to APL and CIT managers to use, as they deem appropriate.  

        Define project/instrument descope options early in the program and develop a plan to implement them in a timely manner.  

        Decide very early in the program to use the same core hardware and software system for Integration and Test (I&amp;T), mission operations and the science data center to provide for greater efficiency, cost savings and better trained operations personnel. This has become the model for many subsequent missions.  

        Establish a review board of technical experts, primarily in the payload area, who are not project staff. Retain the same people on the board for the duration of the development phase. This board worked in an open and trusting environment with the CIT Payload Management office, the Instrument Development Teams, APL and the GSFC Project Office. The board had a very significant impact on the ability of a number of ACE instruments to be successfully completed on time and within budget.

This approach paid big dividends.

2/1/1999,700,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Nonpractice of deterministic fracture mechanics analysis (or test) in a spacecraft or launch vehicle program would result in the failure to meet NASA design requirements for fracture control [references 11 and 12]. Failure to adequately consider fatigue in the design of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads may, at best, result in recurring costs for repair or replacement of components before their intended design life. At worst, a catastrophic failure, in terms of economic loss and loss of life, may result. 

     It is standard JSC engineering practice to specify fracture control requirements on structural and mechanical components that are classified as fracture critical. As a part of these requirements, it is required that a component be shown by analysis or test to be able to survive a deterministic minimum number of service lifetimes (usually 4) without the largest possible undetectable flaw growing to failure [references 11 and 12]. While this process has proven to be adequate to ensure against failure, design practices which do not take advantage of stochastic methods for fracture analysis may produce over-conservative and uneconomical structures and mechanisms. 

     In mechanical or structural system reliability analyses, failure to use a stochastic fatigue or fracture mechanics approach to the estimation of reliability will result in life estimates that are incompatible and inconsistent with the results of the standard NASA deterministic safe-life analyses required by the Space Shuttle and Space Station Programs [references 11 and 12].

Contaminants reacting with ammonia normally produce hydrogen, and the gas collects in the condenser region. As more and more of the condenser is blocked, the surface area available for heat rejection decreases, reducing the heat transfer effectiveness; ultimately, the heat pipe may cease to function. Failure to certify welds at the end caps and the fill tube could result in improper or defective welds permitting leaks or catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel. For long-term space missions, working fluids in the appropriate temperature range, such as methanol and water, exhibit an incompatibility with aluminum, and should not be used. "
2/1/1999,654,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Impact of Nonpractice:  
      
    Adverse effects of electrostatic charges on space vehicle design, development, test and operation sometimes have been serious. Such effects include inadvertent ignition of electroexplosive devices, spurious triggering of electronics, and damage to insulating materials. The ignition, by electrostatic discharge, of the final stage solid rocket motor of the Delta launch vehicle for the Orbiting Solar Observatory spacecraft during test operations killed three men in 1964. Electrostatic discharges previously had ignited a similar motor without loss of life. In addition, failures of several vehicles after launch have been attributed to electrostatic discharges. 

     Electrostatic discharges in the atmosphere can have adverse effects on launch operation. NASA SP-8084, revision of June 1974, gives models that should be applied to electrostatic problems. The lightning strikes on Apollo 12, shortly after liftoff, caused major disturbances to on-board electrical systems. Fortunately, most of the effects in this case were of a temporary nature and the mission was able to continue.

    The absence of high performance cable shielding frequently results in cross interference which degrades hardware operation and can obliterate scientific data. These problems can usually be identified in ground testing, but correcting them by retrofitting flight hardware is very difficult and expensive. Therefore, it is important that cable shielding be included in the early design of hardware. 

     Significant interference problems can occur on orbit that were not corrected during ground testing or were not found due to hardware interference situations that could not be exactly duplicated during ground testing. Also, deterioration or partial failure of components and parts can result in increased levels of radiated emissions. Hardware that is susceptible to these radiated emissions can exhibit problems such as microprocessor resets, false or inaccurate engineering data readouts, unintentional mode changes, and noisy or lost scientific data. Cable shielding minimizes these interference problems by isolating hardware from radiated emissions. 

     Numerous EMC tests at GSFC have demonstrated that unshielded cables and wires such as power leads, thermistor, and thermostat leads pick up radiated emission signals and re-radiate them from all areas of a payload. Additionally, the signals are often conducted inside shielded boxes. These tests have also shown that signal and control leads should have 60 dB or more of shielding effectiveness; whereas, most commercial shielded cable has only 30 to 40 dB of shielding effectiveness.

    As an example of noncompliance, consider a spacecraft bus, containing critical electronic parts, whose shear plate and thermal blanket are adjacent (i.e., not separated by the standoff which characterizes a suitable two-surface particle shield). The largest incident particle, namely that for which the area-fluence product is near unity (ref. Table 1) is then, for long-duration missions in low Earth orbit or in the inner solar system, capable of penetrating the electronics housing or of producing spallation from the inner surface. In either case a single impact introduces numerous fast-moving fragments into the electronics themselves, several electronic parts will be disabled simultaneously, and the probability is high that the subsystem's function will be severely compromised, resulting in mission failure if the subsystem is critical. Even if redundant assemblies are provided, they should not be packaged together, because one particle impact may destroy them both. Even if packaged
    separately, the likelihood of two impacts (of a penetrating particle) is only modestly smaller than that of one impact, so that redundancy is a far more expensive and less effective option than the provision of suitable particle impact shielding in the first place. 

     An equally serious failure resulting from noncompliance is illustrated by the scenario, extensively investigated for the Galileo spacecraft, that a meteoroid penetration of the propellant tanks could result in loss of fuel, a consequent change in the spacecraft velocity vector, unintended reentry into the Earth's atmosphere (instead of the intended close flyby for gravitational assist), and widespread atmospheric dispersion of radioactive fuel from the RTGs (radioisotope thermoelectric generators). In this scenario, failure to provide adequate meteoroid protection could have both life-threatening and major legal consequences, albeit with small probability.

2/1/1999,737,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The CARES computer program is used worldwide for fracture and life prediction of structural ceramic components for automotive, aerospace, electronic, and nuclear applications. Spacecraft are composed of many complex assemblies that contain ceramic materials. CARES is proven software especially useful for ensuring that ceramic components are designed to survive different temperature extremes and stresses in the space environment. 

     Failure to adhere to proven design methods and/or reliability analysis practices could cause shortened mission life, degraded levels of mission success, premature termination of component or experiment operation, and in extreme circumstance, loss of mission and human life. All phases of the spacecraft design process, from design, development, fabrication to installation in the spacecraft, must adhere to proven reliable design and safe practices. "
2/1/1999,735,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Failure to access and survey the MAPTIS system could result in overlooking important materials or process advancements, mistaking vital material parameters, or using materials in applications where they would be subject to potential degradation or failure.

2/1/1999,771,Aeronautics Research," Preferred Practice for Design &amp; Test. Voltage and Temperature Margin Testing (VTMT) is the practice of exceeding the expected flight limits of voltage, temperature, and frequency to simulate the worst case functional performance, including effects of radiation and operating life parameter variations on component parts. For programs subject to severe cost or schedule constraints, VTMT has proven an acceptable alternative to conventional techniques such as worst case analysis (WCA). WCA is the preferred approach to design reliability, but VTMT is a viable alternative for flight projects where trade-offs of risk versus development time and cost are appropriate. ",FALSE," Using neither WCA nor VTMT to simulate circuit functional performance, a unit is subject to functional peril from changes in uncontrolled circuit parameters due to part variations. Inadequate margins can result in sudden failure to operate, or the condition can lead to functional degradation of the circuit with a high probability of catastrophic failure due to drift outside the operational limits of the unit. Lacking insight from test or analysis, the project is likely to lack provisions for detection of these problematic areas in the failure intervention plan. Without the VTMT or WCA parameter change matrix as a readily available diagnostic tool, failure causes and remedies must be determined under post-failure constraints, where time and hardware limitations may inhibit adequate corrective action.
