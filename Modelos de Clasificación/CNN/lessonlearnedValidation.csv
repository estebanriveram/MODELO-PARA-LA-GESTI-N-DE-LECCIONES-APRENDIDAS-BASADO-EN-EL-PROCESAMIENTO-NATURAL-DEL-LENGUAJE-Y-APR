7/17/1996,437,Aeronautics Research," Oversized mounting screws caused apparent damage to capped inserts in a Voyager transponder. When designing or reworking hardware employing capped inserts, it is critical to verify that correct screw lengths are specified and used. ",TRUE, Oversized mounting screws can damage capped inserts. 
7/17/1996,436,Aeronautics Research," A Voyager telemetry failure was attributed to over-length screws that caused conductive end-caps to contact areas not sufficiently coated by conformal coating. The lesson provides recommendations for design of captivated inserts, QA monitoring of assembly, application of conformal coatings, and planning of ground activities. ",TRUE," Effects of both plus and minus component tolerances must be examined in design. 

     Telemetry measurements can be used to detect imbalances between the chassis-supply and chassis-return voltages, such as would be caused by the original Voyager short. "
7/17/1996,435,Aeronautics Research," A SEASAT-A subassembly was damaged during thermal-vacuum test due to the configuration of GSE test equipment. A reed relay in a commercial data scanner was connected to circuits requiring +5 volts; its failure permitted the SEASAT-A circuits to be exposed to scans as high as 31 volts. 

     It is important to assess the design of commercial support equipment and consider what a failure of an internal part might do to the flight hardware.  
     ",TRUE," The problem was caused by using a commercial piece of equipment without looking into its internal nature and considering what a failure in an internal part might do to the flight equipment. Previously, the SAR Transmitter had been tested at the contractor's facility, using the same set-up, with no problem. "
7/17/1996,434,Aeronautics Research," During the Viking program, rust spots were observed on the gold-plated Kovar lids of a number of flat pack ICs. The cause was suspected to be chlorine from the lead tinning operation, and various polymeric coatings failed to prevent further corrosion. 

     Following the use of any chlorinated product, a thorough and complete cleaning to remove all residual chlorine contamination is a necessity.  
     ",TRUE," Corrosion, once started, is extremely difficult to stop. "
7/17/1996,433,Aeronautics Research," Voyager's discovery of defective component lots in welded module assemblies led to a re-procurement of the flight relays. For procurement of parts with a prior history of problem/failures, evaluate the design and workmanship of the current production and determine the need for JPL inspections and special screening tests. ",TRUE," The discovery of defective component lots in welded module assemblies or at any point subsequent to completion of flight hardware fabrication results in major program impacts. There are unavoidable schedule slips due to the re-procurement and replacement of parts and welded modules. Flight hardware quality is jeopardized by the resulting rework and retest effort. 

     The pre-cap visual inspection alone on a densely packed relay provides little insight into the quality of its individual subassemblies. Screening tests are not 100% effective in elimination of defective units. "
7/15/1996,430,Aeronautics Research," During fabrication of the TIROS-N Microwave Sounding Unit, connector cleaning fluids penetrated to the interior of the chassis. This caused severe swelling of the conformal coating material and the subsequent fracture of electronic components, dissolution of polyurethane insulation on the magnet hookup wire, and removal of component identification markings. To preclude detrimental results, care should be exercised in the selection of fluids to be used with or in the presence of polymeric and elastomeric materials. ",TRUE, Most polymeric and elastomeric materials are permeable and are subject to swelling and solvent-stress-cracking when exposed to some fluids. 
7/15/1996,429,Aeronautics Research," In the process of reflow soldering flat pack leads to printed circuit boards during the Voyager program, it was discovered that a high phosphorous content in the plating process for the Kovar leads can weaken solder joints. Evaluate the effects of phosphorus when soldering or welding nickel plated surfaces. ",TRUE, A high phosphorous content in the plating process can weaken solder joints. 
7/12/1996,426,Aeronautics Research," To prove that electrical connections were properly made, a test of motor control circuits was included after fueling and pressurization of tanks. Had slightly higher pressure been present in the fuel tanks when the pilot valve for the motor control was activated, rocket firing could have injured observers and destroyed the spacecraft. Functional tests must be carefully screened against a standing policy that at least two protective elements are included to prevent irreversible action. ",TRUE, Functional tests must be carefully screened against a standing policy that at least two protective elements are included to prevent irreversible action. 
7/12/1996,428,Aeronautics Research," In selecting squibs stored from the Viking Orbiter 1975 program for use in the Voyager 1977 mission, it was found that moisture sealed within the squibs at the time of manufacture had combined with the boron ignition mix to produce boric acid and corrosion. The manufacture of hermetically sealed squibs must preclude the presence of moisture prior to hermetic sealing. Flight quality squibs in bonded storage must receive periodic resistance checks to detect degradation. ",TRUE, The manufacture of hermetically sealed squibs must preclude the presence of moisture prior to hermetic sealing. 
7/10/1996,424,Aeronautics Research," Shortly after the launch of Voyager, unexpected dynamic effects necessitated additional orbit determination analysis, testing, and modeling to ensure an accurate trajectory. Perform careful coordinated pre-flight analysis to determine the impact of such effects as torques induced by solar pressure and gas impingement on the spacecraft structure. Design and test to avoid impingement problems. ",TRUE, Orbit determination complexity is increased significantly when translational accelerations from the attitude control system must be accounted for. 
7/10/1996,422,Aeronautics Research," Following a Viking Orbiter pyrotechnic-actuated event, debris was viewed by the star tracker as numerous bright objects, initiating a command to change the spacecraft roll position. During and following a pyrotechnic event, place the spacecraft in roll inertial and disable any Canopus-loss fault protection software. ",TRUE," Always take the precaution of placing the spacecraft in roll inertial and disabling any Canopus-loss fault protection software at and following a pyrotechnic event. At these times particles are shocked loose from parts of the spacecraft, from whence they drift through the Canopus tracker field of view. "
7/10/1996,425,Aeronautics Research," Though necessary to support mission objectives, the Voyager Ground Data System and Mission Operations System design accommodated very limited real-time commanding. Correcting this required difficult modifications, and the real-time command generation capability still had limitations. Several recommendations are offered to assure that real-time commanding requirements receive careful consideration early in mission design. ",TRUE, Careful determination of real-time commanding requirements must be made early in mission design. 
7/8/1996,418,Aeronautics Research," Since Galileo used inherited Voyager transponders, the mission also inherited the problem that an uplink carrier suppression that is optimal for command purposes tends to degrade X-band telemetry. The lesson describes link accommodations successfully implemented by both Voyager and Galileo. ",TRUE,"With a strong uplink, the command performance requirements can be met with much less than optimum uplink carrier suppression.  

        Some phases of a mission may not require a two-way coherent link.  

        Changes in link configuration require verification through end-to-end performance tests.  
      "
7/8/1996,420,Aeronautics Research," The pressure regulator in the Viking Orbiter Propulsion Subsystem started leaking following a pyro firing that occurred prior to the near-Mars TCM. Likely causes were corrosion or residue from propellant migration or pyro valve blowby, or particulate contamination. Recommendations included using separate regulators for the fuel and oxidizer sides, incorporating a bellows in the pyro valve to eliminate blowby, and adding a isolation valve between the regulator and propellant tank. ",TRUE, The micro-scale effects of long-term propellant exposure should be investigated in order to better critique regulator design. 
7/8/1996,421,Aeronautics Research," The Voyager II Science Boom failed to indicate, by microswitch, that it had deployed completely. The design of deployment mechanisms should consider susceptibility to jamming by foreign objects. Deployment clearance verification testing should be repeated if any related changes are incorporated. ",TRUE," Ideally, deployment verification procedures should be performed on a completely assembled spacecraft subsequent to its final buildup. Mocked-up areas of critical clearance may be used, but their use introduces some risk. "
7/8/1996,419,Aeronautics Research, The SEASAT-A Synthetic Aperture Radar system end-to-end gain was instable due RF leakage that varied with the sensor gain state and with temperature. Use of prototype models and diagnostic RF system analysis and modeling are effective in identifying microwave design susceptibilities to RF leakage. ,TRUE, Test programs must be designed to uncover operating problems. 
7/1/1996,415,Aeronautics Research," During final flight acceptance testing, an RF breakdown in an exciter revealed that its design was subject to RF breakdown at critical pressure. Costly design modifications late in the program were required to correct the design. All RF transmitter components and circuits should be analyzed and tested to determine their performance margin to any kind of RF breakdown. The lesson specifies the minimum margins. ",TRUE,"All RF transmitter components and circuits should be analyzed and tested to determine their performance margin to any kind of RF breakdown.  

        As a goal, all components and circuits should be designed to have a margin equal to a factor of four in power or a factor of two in voltage (6dB) against breakdown.  
      "
7/1/1996,417,Aeronautics Research," Voyager circuit design verification showed that capacitors that were appropriate for use at atmospheric pressures, contained voids that could lead to corona and possible failure in space. This deficiency might not have shown up during testing. The possibility of critical pressure must be eliminated from all circuit parts capable of causing corona or arcing. Testing should not be relied on to catch all design weaknesses. ",TRUE,"Standard circuit designs or parts which operate well at atmospheric pressure need to be verified for vacuum.  

        Circuit changes to solve other problems may induce their own problems. The original problem was an instability in the TWTA power supply caused because the TWT reacted as a negative impedance load, and the power supply helix output voltage was fed back to control the voltage regulator. This problem was corrected by special focusing of the TWT's to minimize their negative load impedance characteristics and by adding a voltage doubler circuit to reduce the power supply's helix voltage output impedance. The changes that corrected the instability problem produced the large AC component on the high-voltage capacitors.  
      "
7/1/1996,416,Aeronautics Research," Qualification testing at extreme cold temperatures found that noise could be generated from the minute differential expansion between semi-rigid aluminum coaxial cables and their attached stainless steel shells. Beware of the intermodulation product phenomenon, and test for it during antenna subsystem pre- and post-environmental tests, after antenna installation on the spacecraft, and prelaunch. ",TRUE, Maintain a rigorous test program for detecting intermodulation products all the way up to launch. This would involve the use of a two-signal intermodulation test-set to assure that coaxial connectors or other components with contacting metal surfaces do not generate intermodulation products. 
6/26/1996,411,Aeronautics Research, Inflight checkout of the Viking Lander relay link transmitter posed the risk of overloading and zenering input transistors in the Orbiter relay receiver. A system design must include requirements for &ldquo;testability&rdquo; and inflight test requirements should be considered in selection of telemetry data points. ,TRUE,"A system design must include requirements for ""testability.""  

        Test requirements may create ""abnormal"" operating modes which are easy to overlook during the design of individual elements of a system.  

        Accurate analysis of the coupling of RF energy between systems physically close to one another, over other than free-space paths, may be intractable, particularly in the presence of adjacent ""structure.""  
      "
6/26/1996,414,Aeronautics Research," Because two RF transistors were overdriven, Mariner 9 exciter RF output showed slow and continual degradation throughout the mission. Short-term tests of RF circuits may not be sufficient to rule out zenering, and testing may be complicated by &ldquo;healing&rdquo; during the off period. ",TRUE," The worst-case analysis of all radio frequency circuits must include verification that transistors have sufficient margin to emitter-to-base zenering. Zenering can also occur in circuits, other than RF, if the emitter-to-base breakdown voltage is exceeded. 

     Inflight variables, such as temperature and operating mode, make the assessment of degradation of this type extremely difficult after launch. "
6/26/1996,413,Aeronautics Research," Because the Viking Orbiter power switching relays were arranged in a matrix, two relays could under certain conditions be inadvertently actuated when only one was commanded. A system control protocol should be established whereby independently requested relay actuations are executed in a predictable manner. ",TRUE, Relay matrices should be designed to prevent actuation of additional relays caused by multiple relays being commanded simultaneously. 
6/26/1996,412,Aeronautics Research," Because, the interface circuit between the Voyager CCS and Power subsystems was not electrically isolated, spacecraft system noise prevented reliable commanding from CCS to Power. This was not discovered until system-level test, and circuit modifications were difficult. Lesson recommendations pertain to system level requirements, design, and early compatibility testing for interface circuits. ",TRUE, The system test phase is too late to discover hardware interface incompatibilities after subsystems have completed qualification testing. 
6/24/1996,407,Aeronautics Research," The composite pattern of two Helios I low-gain antenna elements caused an &ldquo;interferometer effect&rdquo;, with rapidly varying phase and amplitude values occurring over a small but critical portion of the antenna pattern. Design of spacecraft antennas must include careful attention to amplitude and phase characteristics of the combined antenna system pattern, rather than to those of the individual elements alone. ",TRUE," Design of spacecraft antennas must include careful attention to amplitude and phase characteristics of the combined antenna system pattern, rather than to those of the individual elements alone. Communication link analysis must use sufficiently accurate approximations to the actual expected (or measured) antenna system patterns. "
6/24/1996,410,Aeronautics Research, Mutual interference among the two Viking Orbiters and the two Viking Landers caused a loss of downlink carrier lock and telemetry data several times during the Viking extended mission. The Viking experience showed that the types and magnitude of interference can be adequately analyzed (or determined by test) and that the resulting operational constraints can be adequately specified. ,TRUE,"The situation of two deep space vehicles in the same ground station antenna beamwidth results in possible mutual RF interactions not present with ordinary single-spacecraft tracking.  

        The Viking experience showed that the types and magnitude of interference can be adequately analyzed (or determined by test) and that the resulting operational constraints can be adequately specified.  
      "
6/24/1996,409,Aeronautics Research," Because the Voyager 2 failure protection logic was unnecessarily enabled during launch, transient gyro outputs triggered a series of alarming &ldquo;gyro swaps.&rdquo; Careful attention should be given to preclude the possibility of spurious inputs triggering unwanted events when the protection logic is enabled. ",TRUE, It is suggested that failure protection logic be enabled only when the protected components or subsystems are required for spacecraft operation. Careful attention should be given to preclude the possibility of spurious inputs triggering unwanted events when the protection logic is enabled. 
6/24/1996,408,Aeronautics Research," Mariner'71 testing was delayed when replacement of one blown fuse required the removal of a module containing other fuses necessary to the safe testing of the spacecraft, thereby postponing further testing on all the affected components. Located fuses in the fused devices instead of concentrating them in the power subsystem does leave the cabling unprotected by the fuses, but the reliability of the cabling is so high that this lack of protection is usually well justified. ",TRUE," Fuses should be located within the device being fused, rather than concentrating them within the power subsystem. "
6/18/1996,406,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," It is essential for unspent fuel being exhausted through vent lines to be kept as free of oxygen as possible. In the case of this mishap, it was found that air was being intrained in the vent system via an undetected rupture disc vaccuum break. This air, which liquified after ""puddling"" in vent line low points, in combination with the routinely vented gaseous hydrogen, and a flame front emanating from a downline flare stack created an overpressurization event which thereby compromised the piping. "
6/1/1996,547,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Worst-case thermal analyses must include locked-rotor conditions of any moving parts. 
5/20/1996,566,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board made several observations in the course of the investigation. Among these are that: 

      
        the tether failure is not indicative of any fundamental problem in using electrodynamic tethers;  

        there was a significant amount of scientific data secured from the flight, before the tether separated;  

        the science, engineering and support teams were highly competent, motivated, and committed to the experiment;  

        electrostatic charge build-up could be an issue in the future;  

        the documentation provided by the project to the Board was appropriate;  

        the tether configuration was affected by the winding loads on the reel;  

        the load paths of the composite tether are complex;  

        closed areas with a favorable pressure-distance combination (Paschen's Law) can cause arcing if not vented.  
      
    The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board finally observed that the long time span between the fabrication of the hardware and the flight missions increased the exposure of the hardware to contamination and damage.  
      "
5/1/1996,537,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, The best O-ring seal is attained with a commercial O-ring or one with a 45&deg; angle joint. Do not assume that a fabrication shop will put a 45&deg; joint in automatically -- they may have no way of knowing that you are going to use it for vacuum use. 
5/1/1996,538,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Soft items which do not seem capable of creating interferences may actually lead to crucial conflicts which are only caught in assembly or testing because they were not shown on assembly drawings. 
5/1/1996,539,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Everything that is accessible to astronauts or ground crew must have safeties designed in to guard against inadvertent activation. 
5/1/1996,536,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Clean room certified adhesive tape 5413 looks just the same as clean room certified adhesive tape 1205, but 5413 contains a silicone-based adhesive that is not compatible with vacuum work. 1205 has an acrylic adhesive that can be baked to reduce outgassing. "
4/26/1996,404,Aeronautics Research," When commanded to switch on, TWTA No. 1 on Viking Lander 2 failed to produce an S-band RF downlink, probably due to RF breakdown of the high-voltage power converter. High-voltage circuits designed to operate within the Martian atmosphere require special design precautions, such as insulation from ground potential, to avoid corona or other forms of high-voltage breakdown. ",TRUE, High-voltage circuits designed to operate within the Martian atmosphere require that special design precautions be taken to avoid corona or other forms of high-voltage breakdown. 
4/26/1996,405,Aeronautics Research," Unlike explicit commands, stepping or incremental commands, however, simply cause the device to move by the commanded increment from its current position to the new position. If the current position is incorrect, the next position and all subsequent positions will be incorrect. The use of explicit commands is recommended whenever no significant operational advantage exists using incremental commands. Should an incremental command capability be desired for other reasons, the system design should consider also implementing the explicit command capability to ensure fault tolerance. ",TRUE," All commands, whether stepping or explicit, have within them a potential for error. However, since explicit commands do not depend on the success of previous commands to be successful, they tend to be ""fault-tolerant,"" in the sense that they do not perpetuate errors in the command sequence. "
4/19/1996,402,Aeronautics Research," Multi-year storage and aging of solder plated terminals for TOPEX and ASTROS circuit boards affected their solderability. Consider aging and solderability factors, and perform solderability tests, before installing solder plated terminals. ",TRUE,"Solder plated brass terminals have a limited shelf life after initial manufacture or reprocessing.  

        Surface deterioration may set in after approximately two years in an air ambient environment.  

        Failure to take aging and solderability factors into account before installing solder plated terminals may have serious consequences.  
      "
4/1/1996,543,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, An EMI filter may not perform as well when it is not matched with the power converter it is meant to operate with. 
4/1/1996,548,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," All Shuttle middeck payloads have to have the habitable compartment offgassing test done on them (LaRC payloads MACE, GPPM, MIDAS had this done at White Sands) -- check with JSC Safety if unsure. It is possible to send a mock-up unit only, that only includes the same non-metallics as are in the flight payload, but does not have to be operational. "
4/1/1996,546,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Even if pressure changes will be extremely small, have vent holes designed in everything by CDR. "
4/1/1996,544,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," When you have a part that is a possible suspect for EMI, always test it separately for EMI as early as possible, rather than waiting and testing the whole payload and finding out then that you have to change one component. This can be an informal test in a local facility, and not require money, excessive procedures, or time. "
4/1/1996,542,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," It is possible to not have a 5:1 ratio of N2 to O2 in a vacuum chamber that has a steady leak, when there is a cryopump running that will preferentially pump the O2. "
4/1/1996,545,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," If a system is baked with the ion pump off, the contaminants driven off of the chamber walls during baking may be driven into the pump, and it will then take quite a while to be able to restart it. If the system is not baked sufficiently, then the act of turning on a vacuum ion gauge will drive so much water off the walls of the chamber and gauge that the ion pump may not be able to continue running. "
2/1/1996,541,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," If a complete tally of all vacuum loads is not done before a pump is selected, the pump chosen may be over- or under-powered for the job. "
2/1/1996,540,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," If you do not specify on your purchase order for hermetic connectors, it is possible that they will be shipped with the inserts loose. "
1/1/1996,427,Aeronautics Research," A crack in an RF circuit ceramic substrate was revealed by a potentially mission catastrophic loss of output power during thermal-vacuum test of a sensor module. This crack was due to substrate weakening caused by use of a dental drill used for circuit tuning (by removing conductor material) during the final amplifier assembly process. Microwave RF circuit design that involves the practice of flight unit tuning by removal of conductive material, such as by use of abrasive or cutting tools, should be compatible with the substrate and circuit material, the packaging design, and other relevant factors. The Lesson Learned and Recommendations section in this 1977 lesson learned were revised in 2006 to reflect current practice in the use of abrasive and cutting tools to tune RF circuits. ",TRUE," The tuning of RF circuits using abrasive or cutting tools to remove conductive material from the boards may cause mission critical damage that is not easily detectable.
 "
10/11/1995,360,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The loss of air data from a single-string Pitot-static source due to icing or foreign object damage, can result in a departure from controlled flight (and possible catastrophic loss of aircraft) in aircraft which are inherently unstable and dependent on air data for dynamic stability. "
10/11/1995,361,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," In the case of an over land ejction and depending on pilot/payload weight, the 17 foot diameter main parachute in the F-18 egress system can allow a sufficiently high descent rate as to make parachute landing fall injury highly probable. "
10/11/1995,359,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Even in normally dry, temperate environments, humidity/temperature conditions at flight altitude can be such as to result in icing of the Pitot-static probe if a heater is not provided. "
9/17/1995,457,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Low hazard systems must be addressed by supporting safety engineering analyses (failure modes and effects, hazard analysis, etc.) to identify vulnerabilities at the interface with high hazard systems. Such analyses will identify the need for additional and/or modified controls. "
9/17/1995,458,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE,"Coordination of discrete operations in a facility is needed to preclude the deactivation of required emergency systems especially during a hazardous operation or test activity.

6/12/1995,447,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Components may have anomalies that are within specification and which later become the source of other problems. 
6/12/1995,477,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Modification of IRT fan blades can result in more accurate data or higher test section airspeeds. 
6/12/1995,476,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Insufficient amount of time given to the payload crew to perform initial experiments in Zero-G can result in incomplete experiments. 
6/12/1995,446,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Insufficient notification of the latest flight procedure changes to the KSC-Payloads Group can lead to inaccurate tracking of Spacelab's configuration following landings. 
6/8/1995,401,Science, An extended Voyager mission was feasible due to engineering improvements that permitted the use of redundant hardware to enhance science return. ,TRUE,"A spacecraft design which enables the implementation of an image motion compensation capability can make possible extremely long image exposures while minimizing image smear.  

        Spacecraft system architecture and subsystem implementations which allow utilization of redundant elements for operational elements during critical periods of the mission are key to enabling expanded spacecraft mission operations. These redundant elements can be utilized even though the prime elements remain operational.  

        Maintenance of a complete flight software development and validation capability during the mission, to allow utilization of the designed spacecraft software flexibility after launch, will enable significant enhancement of science data return.

6/8/1995,400,Science," As Mariner 10 approached Venus encounter, an uncontrolled oscillation occurred due to spacecraft structural interaction with the Attitude Control Subsystem. The result was a severe consumption of control gas that would have caused failure of the mission had it continued. The recommendations center on design and operational measures to cope with subtle and complex dynamical interactions between the spacecraft structure and the ACS. ",TRUE, Spacecraft structural dynamical interactions with the Attitude Control Subsystem can be very subtle and complex. 
6/7/1995,397,Science," While on the launch pad, Viking experienced an anomalous power turn-on that resulted in a total discharge of the spacecraft batteries. Failure analysis had not detected that discrete failure of a relay located in support equipment could have caused the problem. All interfaces with the spacecraft should be subject to failure mode analysis, status indicators or alarms should be used, and the spacecraft should not be left unattended unless periodic monitoring is conducted. ",TRUE,"Failure mode analysis can disclose potential fault scenarios and indicate prudent preventive action.  

        Periodic monitoring of spacecraft can provide detection of anomalous conditions.  
      "
6/7/1995,399,Science," During arc welding of a Galileo propulsion fuel line, an arc to the spacecraft caused an uncontrolled transient pulse of current that flowed through portions of the spacecraft structure and electronics. The potential for anomalies to introduce transient currents prompted recommendations involving interface design, planning of welding operations, and evaluation of electrical and insulation characteristics. ",TRUE,"The complicated thermal and mechanical interface design of the RPM forced welding assembly and disassembly operations into a confined area, leading directly to a hazardous operation.  

        Unforeseen anomalies can introduce uncontrolled transient pulses of current into mechanisms which are not designed to conduct electricity.

6/7/1995,396,Science," Shortly after transmitter turn-on, SIR-B suffered a radiated power drop. After Shuttle landing, troubleshooting discovered a sliver of metal embedded in the center conductor of the GFE antenna cable. For critical GFE components, obtain copies of the test procedures and the test data; perform RF breakdown and end-to-end system tests. ",TRUE,"Review and verification of test procedures and test data from critical components supplied as GFE by other organizations ensures that project testing requirements have been met.  

        RF breakdown tests on RF generation or amplification and antenna feed system components provide assurance that the components meet flight operational requirements.  

        End-to-end system tests are particularly critical if the system includes data generation and data flow.  
      "
6/7/1995,398,Science," After rework of a Galileo subsystem, it was discovered that the size of PWB traces in a subsystem power supply had the effect of limiting voltages elsewhere in the system. The problem was corrected by adding conductors in parallel with the traces. 

     Subsystem design analysis must consider all aspects of the end-to-end implementation, and subsystem testing must duplicate all aspects of the flight system configuration that could affect subsystem performance.  
     ",TRUE, The trace size of subsystem printed wiring board conductors can affect system level voltages. 
6/6/1995,395,Science," Before the first Mercury encounter, the MVM'73 high gain antenna suddenly lost 3 dB in gain and changed from circular to linear in polarization. It was suspected that either particles or chips left in the S-band feed cavity after antenna assembly caused a short circuit, or a combination of tolerance build-up and thermal effects caused a dimensional change. Worst case analysis should be preformed on any equipment suspected to be sensitive to assembly practices or tolerance build-up. ",TRUE,"A worst case analysis could have predicted potential performance anomalies of equipment susceptible to tolerance build-up.

12/1/1994,882,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Rotating equipment (i.e., pumps, motors, compressors) are sensitive to the alignment to each other and to the smallest of changes due to operating conditions. Proper alignment is the largest factor in determining the life of bearings, seals and couplings. Even ""flexible"" couplings fail to completely absorb the additional stresses caused by misalignment. Misalignment causes these crucial components to become overloaded and break down prematurely, especially when operating at high speed.

12/1/1994,837,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, The reliability of a system's BIT can be determined in part by the number of false alarms it experiences. If the BIT can not accurately identify and report the occurrence of failures then the test has failed its mission. Testability must be treated with the same level of importance as other design disciplines. BIT reliability must be considered just as critical as any other performance requirement.

Lower downtime and less complicated maintenance actions will be needed when maintenance is required. 
12/1/1994,830,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Detection of anomalous behavior is critical during the operation of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Increasing the detectability of failures during the steady-state operation of the SSME will minimize the likelihood of costly engine damage and maintenance. The average power signal algorithm is superior to the time series algorithm because more parameters contribute to the first simultaneous failure indication times. This increases the agreement between several parameters, thus increasing the likelihood that an engine anomaly has occurred. This method also reduces the number of false failure indications that can prematurely shut down the engine during testing or operation. "
12/1/1994,829,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The development of the Space Station and other space systems (i.e., Space Station payloads and experiments) requiring long-term maintenance support dictates maintenance planning with emphasis on an understanding of the level of support required over a given period of time.

12/1/1994,724,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The need to identify quantity, cost, types of spares, and related servicing techniques required to sustain a space system mission capability is a prime driver in developing maintainability requirements for a space system at the onset of its design. A system maintenance concept should be developed to define the basis for establishing maintainability requirements and to support design in the system conceptual phase. The maintenance concept provides the practical basis for design, layout, and packaging of the system and its equipment. The number of problems associated with product support and maintenance of space systems can be reduced, if not eliminated, by applying the principles prescribed in the system's maintenance concept. "
12/1/1994,855,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, System gas must be conditioned before it is allowed to enter a new system. Installing filters immediately upstream of interfaces achieves this objective and also reduces dirt and water contamination that can interfere with component and system operation. 
12/1/1994,849,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Predictive maintenance is a technique which checks the ""health"" of an item while it is operating using one or more sophisticated tools. The capabilities for predictive maintenance exists because of the availability of desktop computers, and the increased sophistication of equipment monitoring instruments. Too much or too little maintenance is avoided because the equipment is monitored on a regular basis providing trend data that can be used to project probable machine alarm dates. According to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the annual maintenance cost of such a program is reduced by 50% or more to between $7 and $9 per horsepower. "
12/1/1994,848,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," While this practice may seem to be one that would routinely be found in a maintenance program, in reality that's not so. All too often it is assumed that a new part is not only serviceable, but that it also meets the specification requirements as advertised. However, due to process variables, inspection techniques, and even fraud, this is not always the case. Example: in February 1992 KSC was alerted by NASA HQ/Code QR that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission working with the Inspector General was issuing a GIDEP/Alert on suspect circuit breakers. The situation described that a particular vendor took used circuit breakers from various manufacturers, refurbished the exterior only, falsified circuit breaker data and sold them as new components. These breakers had experienced premature trip, failure to trip (some breakers were not of proper amperage, i.e., mislabeled), and some had exploded. Had KSC not had practice GP-1002, ""Maintenance and Test Criteria for Circuit Breakers,""
        in place, suspect circuit breakers could have easily been introduced into KSC's GSE and Facility equipment supporting the Space Shuttle Program. A maintenance program that provides for testing of circuit breakers prior to or upon installation will eliminate these types of failures. "
12/1/1994,847,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," The testing provides cost savings thru detection of leaks in air/fluid systems that are not normally audible. Compressors and fluid pumps may run at above normal requirements to make up for the loss caused by leaks creating unnecessary costs to power the equipment. Bearing problems can be evaluated over a period of time to detect progressive wear by changes in the ultrasound intensity level, thus protecting the bearing from sudden failure. Testing of electrical systems for sounds of arcing is easily accomplished enabling loose connections and openings to be found. Ultrasound testing is one of the least complex and less expensive maintenance detection methods, requiring a hand held detector and associated meter. "
12/1/1994,846,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Ferrography is a wear particle analysis utilizing diagnostic and predictive techniques to evaluate the on-line condition of interacting lubricated or fluid powered parts or components. The use of Ferrography to evaluate a system's condition is to avoid time-consuming and potentially damaging hardware teardown and other destructive or interfering inspections. Ferrography can analyze a system's fluid to determine the type of wear it is experiencing; and, hence, predict the type of system failure and when the failure may occur. Ferrography can provide an established and easily performed inspection method for determining the health of a system and providing an early failure detection method. "
12/1/1994,845,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Predictive maintenance is a condition driven preventive maintenance program. Instead of relying on industrial average-life statistics to schedule maintenance activities, predictive maintenance uses direct monitoring of the mechanical condition, system efficiency, and other indicators to determine the most efficient time to service a piece of machinery. Since mechanical systems or machines account for the majority of equipment, vibration monitoring is generally the key component of most predictive maintenance programs because it can provide the greatest benefits. Also, equipment down time is not required for vibration analysis to occur. "

12/1/1994,843,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Digital potentiometers should be considered in new design or major redesign of electronic systems where comprehensive system control, monitoring, configuration and calibration functions are desired (both locally and remotely). Standard devices (electromechanical potentiometers) are limited to manual control. System analysis will reveal strategic points for the inclusion of digital potentiometers to maximize utilization of their remote capabilities and superior noise characteristics. Substitution of standard variable resistance devices with digital potentiometer based circuits will result in enhanced capabilities while yielding reduced maintenance resource impact. "
12/1/1994,842,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE, Maintenance effort and system downtime will be reduced by the implementation of common charge points for lubrication systems on mechnical ground support equipment. 
11/14/1994,351,Aeronautics Research," During confidence testing of the MBB Galileo Ten Newton (N) Engine at MBB in November 1988, rapid increases in combustion chamber temperature (&ldquo;hot starts&rdquo;) were sometimes observed immediately after ignition of the engine. Examination of test data from the previous flight engine acceptance tests showed evidence of hot starts, but JPL had not witnessed these earlier tests. 

     The lesson recommends several measures to assure that rocket engine development and qualification test instrumentation and test documentation are sufficient to detect and diagnose combustion instabilities.  
     ",TRUE,"Lack of appropriate rocket engine development and qualification test instrumentation and test documentation can result in failure to detect and diagnose combustion instabilities.  

        Bubbles saturated in the propellant can be a contributing factor to triggering rocket engine combustion instability.

11/14/1994,1604,Aeronautics Research," The F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle has proven to be a useful research tool with many unique capabilities. Many of these capabilities are to assist in characterizing flight at high angles of attack, while some provide significant research in their own right. Of these, the thrust vectoring system, the unique ability to rapidly reprogram flight controls, the reprogrammable mission computer, and a reprogrammable On-Board-Excitation-System have allowed an increased utility and versatility of the research conducted. Because of this multi-faceted approach to research in the high angle of attack regime, the capabilities of the F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle were designed to cover as many high alpha technology bases as the program would allow. These included aerodynamics, controls, handling qualities, structures, instrumentation, flight avionics systems, and propulsion. To achieve these goals, new capabilities were developed to enable this research to occur some were outstandingly successful; others were not.  
     ",TRUE," 1. Use of an all-inclusive steering committee of all the stakeholders was an outstanding asset to the execution of the program. Being all inclusive meant all voices were heard, and even when unanimous decisions were not reachable, consensus was achieved, which maintained long term viability of the program and the project. Frequent communication was essential for this to happen within the steering committee.  
      
    2. Insufficient systems approach to the facilities, equipment, and planning occurred. Despite having extensive experience within the team with systems engineering, insufficient excess capacity was designed into the system because the entire lifecycle was not understood at inception. Requirements creep resulted in taking additional time, effort, and energy to incorporate research which was not mature at the start of the design.  
      
    3. Careful attention to risk management, both programmatic and technical, was a valuable asset in every phase of the program. In particular, sensitivity to the aircraft systems was paramount.  
      
    3a. In one instance, the aircraft's flight control computers failed to pass the Built-In Test on several occasions during the Day-of-Flight checks before passing the Built-In Test. As the pilot and crew continued the preparation for flight, several engineers in the control room stopped, took stock of the situation, and decided to cancel the mission until the reason for the failures was understood for the aircraft not passing the Built-In Test.  
      
    3b. In another instance, the Spin Recovery System (spin parachute) was reinstalled on the aircraft. The convention at that time was to fire the chute system from a benign flight condition as a system test. In most spin parachute systems, there is a small (but finite) potential for loss of the aircraft if the chute cannot be jettisoned. In the case of the F-18 HARV, the project team decided to fire the chute on the ground in a high-speed taxi test only (this was done twice) and to NOT fire the system in-flight as a system test. This reduced the risk exposure to the aircraft and flight crew, while still testing the system in a representative environment. It should be noted that two other high angle of attack programs decided to fire the spin parachute in-flight as a system test (X-29A and X-31A).  
      
    3c. As well as making careful estimates for improvements and changes, be sure to define, well in advance and with careful planning, the deletion of specific envelope expansion hardware (or safety hardware). This needs to be carefully coordinated as part of the continuing airworthiness and flight safety process. In the case of the F-18 HARV, after the envelope expansion was complete, the need for the spin recovery system and the emergency power systems (battery back-ups, another system that was tested and demonstrated in ground tests) could have been removed from the aircraft. A current example might be the Fight Termination System onboard a UAV, or a system augmentation of the Flight Termination System.  
      
    4. Testing, both ground and flight, always uncovers deficiencies and contingencies that need to be planned in. This is true in the integration phase, but also (and in particular with one-of-a-kind research systems) in the flight phase. One aspect of this was the use of carrying extra flight cards in the briefed cards for a mission. Even though we knew we could not achieve all the test points, excess cards were always carried. If one piece of instrumentation failed during a mission, then other cards could be substituted and a full mission could be flown. Up to 140% of a mission's cards would be carried on every mission. Having these contingencies in mind during planning is useful as well. If a particular flight control load developed unforeseen problems, a previous load (for which lower priority test points are still waiting to be flown) can be reloaded and lower priority missions continue while the unforeseen difficulties are resolved. The ground testing of the system wa greatly streamlined by the presence of the Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation residing at Dryden. The hardware simulation, being co-located with the aircraft and the research team, minimized impacts to the schedule.  
      
    5. Use of a Class B envelope for Class B software (flight control laws) is very useful. However, careful attention needs to be paid to the corners of the Class B envelope to assure that, truly, the envelope is Class B. In particular, the lower right corner (for static structural loads) and the upper right corner (for flutter), and the upper left corner (for aeroservoelastics). Class B software is quickly reconfigurable, and flexible.

11/11/1994,350,Aeronautics Research," After Galileo completed its second Earth flyby, communication signal levels received on Earth decreased and fluctuated unexpectedly. The cause was determined to be interference that was not detected during test because the test article was not consistent with the orbiter telecommunications functional requirements document. 

     Recommendations involved use of concurrent engineering, verification of requirements compliance, updating of requirements documents based on hardware ECR's, post test evaluation of non-flight like characteristics, and assuring that hardware used for functional testing properly simulates the characteristics of the flight hardware.  
     ",TRUE," Approval of hardware Engineering Change Requests (ECR's) which conflict with functional requirements documents, without concurrently updating the requirements documents, can result in subsystem functional testing which does not adequately simulate the characteristics of the flight hardware. "
11/4/1994,362,Aeronautics Research," Loss of Magellan telemetry data was traced to moisture contamination due to a subcontractor's failure to use dry gas in the repackaging of an operational amplifier. Recommendations involve use of fault tree analysis, appropriate component screening and qualification, minimizing power cycling, and using dry gas. ",TRUE," In-flight failures cannot always be conclusively analyzed using available telemetry data.  

        Failure to qualify electronic components and assembly capabilities to mission environmental requirements (including numerous power/thermal cycles) increases risk.  

        Power cycling can create thermal cycle effects on internal failure mechanisms for electronic components and assemblies.  

        Not using dry gas in the repackaging process can allow moisture to be trapped inside electronic components (hermetically sealed packages with a cavity) and possibly create pinholes if they don't already exist. Water can also evolve from thermally induced decomposition of the epoxy die attach. Moisture could then combine with the phosphate glass to generate corrosive phosphoric acid that can make the electronic component inoperative.  
      "
10/26/1994,349,Aeronautics Research," Early in the flight, Magellan REM temperatures exceeded predictions by over 20 degrees C. for certain spacecraft orientations. This necessitated changes in the mission profile. Subsystem thermal design modifications had been made based solely on analysis and implemented without any test verification. Design changes should be verified by test. The prime contractor should be responsible for thermal integration of the REM. The REM should be subjected to a series of solar thermal vacuum orientations at the subsystem level. ",TRUE,"Subsystem thermal design modifications based solely on analysis and implemented without any test verification can result in unexpected system level constraints.  

        System thermal integration analysis and testing can function as an independent verification of subsystem thermal design.

",TRUE," Based on Magellan analysis and test plus work recently performed in support of Mars Observer, the design for electro-explosive-device initiation may be inadequate. "
10/21/1994,347,Aeronautics Research," When a contractor was absorbed by a second contractor early during the performance of the Mars Observer contract, the new contractor's management implemented methods that were not consistent with the original, agreed upon plans for integration and test. This created problems between JPL and the new contractor management. 

     Reconfirm the contract should major changes occur in the contractors organization, document critical technical and programmatic agreements, and revalidate agreements when changes in key personnel occur.  
     ",TRUE,"Problems can arise when major management changes occur at the contractor such as a corporate takeover.

10/21/1994,346,Aeronautics Research," Although inherited designs were to be used extensively, many Mars Observer spacecraft subsystems were so extensively modified over the 8-plus year development period that their heritage was lost. Perform inheritance reviews to span differences in design usages, ensure inheritance reviews include the assessments listed in the lesson, and perform delta reviews when major mission changes occur. ",TRUE," Reliance on heritage hardware/software in spacecraft design, without a thorough analysis of compatibility with mission requirements and required changes, can result in the use of design and components which are inappropriate for the mission. "
10/10/1994,345,Aeronautics Research," From the analyses performed after the Mars Observer mission failure, it became apparent that the MO fault protection suffered from a lack of top-down system engineering design approach. Most fault protection was in the category of low-level redundancy management. It was also determined that the MO fault protection software was never tested on the flight spacecraft before launch. Design fault protection to detect and respond to excessive attitude control errors, use RCS Thrusters to control excessive attitude control errors, and always test fault protection software on the flight spacecraft before launch. ",TRUE,"MO fault protection did not detect and respond to excessive attitude control errors.  

        RCS Thrusters were not used to correct excessive attitude control errors.

10/7/1994,530,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Airborne CO flux measurements over the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) indicate low negative flux values over the coastal areas, while some positive fluxes were observed in the inland, sparsely forested regions. Analyses indicate the possibility of in situ photochemical destruction/production of CO. Tundra surfaces are estimated to be responsible for approximately 32% of the total deposition loss of O3 poleward of 60 degrees north. Data from the airborne O3 flux measurements made during this study indicate similar values of RC for the Alaskan North Slope (ANS) and YKD. "
10/6/1994,529,Aeronautics Research,,FALSE," Although this fire happened some time ago, there were no personnel injuries, and damage was relatively minor, there were some significant lessons learned: 

      
        Sparks and hot chips generated during the cutting operations apparently came to rest in a hidden area, created a hot spot, and, approximately 90 minutes after cutting operations were completed, the hot spot ignited into a full fire. Fire watches normally cease one hour after cutting operations are ended. Under certain circumstances, such as those found in this situation, existing procedures may be inadequate to insure no fire hazard remains. Therefore, each job should be individually evaluated to make sure the fire watch surveillance period is sufficient.  

        Security measures should cover entry of emergency personnel to controlled/limited access areas. Unnecessary delays can significantly increase fire damage.  

        In this incident, use of material stored in ready access for the covering of electronic equipment in the event of fire prevents water damage. Readiness of this type of material could have benefit in other facilities should a fire occur.  

        Standpipe system bosses in the Building 1268A complex weren't long enough for the most effective use in fighting this fire. Subsequently, an additional 50' of hose has been added to each standpipe location.

9/29/1994,343,Aeronautics Research," Following the loss of the Mars Observer spacecraft, simulations showed that a postulated propellant breach would have caused angular accelerations that could have inhibited downlink and caused multi-axis gyro saturation. In this case, fault protection features of flight software would have inhibited all momentum unloading and prevented the stabilization of the spacecraft. 

     Ensure that fault protection takes proper action regardless of spacecraft state. Fault responses should not be allowed to interrupt critical activities.  
     ",TRUE, Inappropriate fault protection actions can be as hazardous as the failure the system was designed to protect against.

A year later, a screw attaching a PRD to the Ulysses RTG seized and sheared. The problem was attributed to inexperience with the helicoil locking feature. Avoid use of helicoils, and provide detailed assembly procedures for locking devices. ",TRUE," Helicoil locking devices can cause problems in applications requiring repeated engagements of the locking feature.

     The lesson offers 10 recommendations (dealing mostly with mission rules, launch constraints, and communications) to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve overall range operations. ",FALSE," The Review Committee concluded that the primary cause for this incident was that the Range Safety abort was rescinded without on net authority and range awareness. The principal contributing factors to this incident were the off net communications; and confusion that resulted from having two separate operational nets, the lack of sufficiently detailed and attended prelaunch briefings, and the lengthy process of communicating with the B-52. 

     The Review Committee during its investigation has compiled a list of findings and conclusions. They have been grouped in the following categories: 

      
        Abort Process  

        Mission Rules  

        Communications  

        Launch Day Roles and Responsibilities  

        Mission Planning and Preparation  
      

     ABORT PROCESS 

     FINDINGS 

      
        An abort was initiated by the WFF/RSO, the abort was rescinded by the contractor TC without on net authority and range awareness.  

        The B-52 was required to reduce altitude just prior to the CDR dropout abort call.  

        WFF, Eastern Range (ER), Merritt Island Tracking Station (MILA) and Bermuda Tracking Station (BDA) responded in a manner which allowed continued flight of the Pegasus after launch  

        There was no procedure in the WFF/OSD or the Contractor Launch Checklist (LC) that detailed the procedure for rescinding an abort.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

     From the above findings, the Committee reached the following conclusions: 

      
        The contractor TC method of rescinding the abort was inadequate.  

        Fin battery actuation was a consideration in the decision to rescind the abort.  

        The altitude problem may have contributed to the confusion concerning the abort.  

        Capability to destruct the Pegasus was maintained throughout the flight.  

        Quick positive reaction by all supporting personnel allowed this flight to continue to a successful conclusion.  
      

     MISSION RULES 

     FINDINGS 

      
        An apparent dropout of a Flight Termination System (FTS) CDR occurred. This apparent dropout required an abort of the launch according to the mission rules.  

        Not all key personnel were aware of all mission rules. Additionally, in some cases, key personnel had different interpretations of mission rules.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

      
        There were misunderstandings among key personnel concerning the mission rules. Lack of awareness and misinterpretation of mission rules may have contributed to this incident.  

        The FTS CDR dropout mission rule produced a high risk of mission abort. The complex routing of the data stream (vehicle/aircraft to ground, ground to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) satellite, satellite to ground) and the amount of support equipment necessary to provide this data (decoms, bit syncs, cabling) produced a high probability of data loss not related to CDR health.  
      

     COMMUNICATIONS 

     FINDINGS 

      
        No single Intercom Channel (IC) was understood by all key participants as the primary launch net.  

        The WFF/RSO chain of communication to the B-52 required 3 intermediaries.  

        The configuration of communication equipment used by NASA 1 and the contractor TC was operationally awkward.  

        Formal intercom net protocol was not consistently used.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

      
        The lack of a single IC for all critical calls that was monitored by all key personnel contributed to confusion and to the range's lack of knowledge of impending launch.  

        The chain of communication between the WFF/RSO and the B-52 contained too many elements.  

        Improved intercom net discipline may have prevented misunderstandings leading to the unplanned launch.  

        The contractor TC had expected to receive Range abort calls from the WFF/RCO on IC 4. The fact that the abort was only transmitted on IC 1 by the WFF/TD and heard off net by the contractor TC caused the contractor TC to question the abort call and delayed the passing of the abort to the B-52.  
      

     LAUNCH DAY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

     FINDINGS 

      
        There were no clear lines of authority and responsibility for launch decisions.  

        The OSC/TC rescinded the abort command without proper on net authority and range awareness.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS 

      
        The primary cause of this incident was that the OSC/TC rescinded the abort without on net authority and range awareness. The lack of clear lines of authority and responsibility contributed to his/her actions.  

        The limited abort scenarios exercised during the dress rehearsal were not sufficient to identify all authority and responsibility conflicts.  
      

     MISSION PLANNING AND PREPARATION 

     FINDINGS 

      
        No pre-launch briefing was held at which all key participants reviewed mission rules, constraints, and procedures.  

        The WFF/Operations and Safety Directive (OSD) and the Contractor's Launch Operations and Mission Constraints (LOMC) document contained conflicting information that was not completely integrated in the mission planning process.  

        A complete dress rehearsal was not conducted for this mission.  
      

     CONCLUSIONS

11/18/1992,217,Exploration Systems," During propellant loading operations for the Galileo retro propulsion module prior to launch, an oxidizer loading flex line developed a small leak. The leak was caused by an electrostatic charge generated by the flow of the non-conductive oxidizer through the teflon flex line, discharging to the wire mesh covering.

Consider using new flex lines when hazardous loading operations are performed. Determine maximum flow rates that will prevent electrostatic discharges.

11/12/1992,1187,Exploration Systems,,FALSE," An SPC Investigation Team and an independent NASA Investigation Board were unable to determine the exact cause of the close call. The closest duplication of the event was obtained from the Malfunction Laboratory tests of the crane metadyne and the crane 4NCR relay contacts. A metadyne is an externally driven D.C. generator, which amplifies an operator initiated control signal to regulate trolley speed. When closed, the 4NCR relay contacts provide the control signal to the metadyne. 

     Other crane components that could have caused an increase in trolley speed were removed from crane #1 and tested in the Malfunction Laboratory. None exhibited abnormal results. The Board recognized that operator actions could have produced the observed segment motion. However, based on testimony of the two operators, the investigation board concluded that the operators most likely did not induce the rapid unexpected movement of the segment. 

     Metadyne output voltage changes with no change to the input voltage were observed on numerous occasions during crane tests as well as during Malfunction Laboratory testing. These output changes could be induced by misaligning brushes, lightly tapping the brushes, injecting cleaning stone silica or cleaning cloth fibers into the commutator/brush area, or elevating humidity and temperature. Further the crane metadynes are operated at 2 percent of output capacity, which exacerbates these output instabilities. Review of text books and technical papers, and conversations with technical experts indicate that metadyne systems are susceptible to erratic outputs. The voltage output changes observed in the lab were significant in magnitude and, based on analysis, were large enough to produce the maximum calculated trolley velocity. 

     On September 14, 1992, in VAB High Bay #2, crane #2 bridge (same design as crane #1) experienced erratic acceleration, other unexpected responses, and eventually stopped completely. Troubleshooting determined that the control voltage input to the metadyne system was zero. Relay contacts that provide this control voltage were cleaned and crane operations returned to normal. Additional Malfunction Laboratory tests were performed on the power supply relay contacts and potentiometers. The relay contacts should have a resistance in the milliohm range but laboratory measurements were unstable and in the range of 100 ohms to 3 gigaohms. High resistance of the power supply contacts on the night of the close call could have occurred and, after a few minutes, the high resistance could have returned to normal. This would result in a sudden increase of trolley speed from a reduced to a full FINE speed condition of approximately 25 feet per minute. This very closely duplicates the timing
    and speeds that occurred during the close call. 

     In summary, the exact cause of this crane close call is not known. The most likely causes were determined to be an erratic operation of the metadyne caused by cleaning material contamination of the brush/commutator area or an excessive resistance increase of the control system relay contacts that suddenly returned to its proper value. 

     The contributing cause to the close call was determined to be that metadyne output varies with constant input. 

     Because metadynes are susceptible to unexpected changes in output, careful consideration of design and operating controls is required. Proper relay contact selection is especially important in a low current control system. "

4/9/1992,1186,Exploration Systems,,FALSE," It is the opinion of this mishap investigation team that the primary cause of this mishap was structural failure of the crane at the turret/mast interface, most probably due to fatigue cracking of the welded area in question. This area had cracked at some previous time and there is evidence of continued crack generation resulting in diminished load lifting capability of the crane. When the switch plate kits were loaded, their weight would not normally have exceeded the lifting capacity of the unit but did exceed its diminished capability. The result was a catastrophic failure leading to personnel injury and equipment damage. 

     Contributing to the failure cause was possible momentary overloading of the crane. No data was discovered that indicated the crane had been overloaded and in fact, the design of the hydraulic system precludes that from happening. No evidence was found, however, of operator training beyond on-the-job experience and that lack of proper training could have resulted in poor operating technique imparting momentary loads well in excess of crane capability, setting up a progressive fatigue cracking mechanism. The weld area in question had cracked at some time prior to this failure and there was evidence of attempts to repair cracks. The workmanship of this repair was extremely poor and failed to correct the problem. The fatigue cracking continued to progress to the point of failure. 

     Also noted during this investigation were deficiencies in meeting contractual and OSHA/ANSI requirements. No evidence was found of daily, weekly, or monthly safety inspections of the equipment or contractually required safety reports. No evidence was found of an annual inspection for safety and operability. No evidence was found that the operators had received any training beyond on-the-job instruction on operation of the unit. The injured employee was to be transported to the hospital by a NASA helicopter but this wasn't done due to a lack of proper transport capability of the helicopter. "

9/3/1990,1199,Exploration Systems,,FALSE," The primary and major contributory causes of the mishap were:  
     

      
        Failure to remove the beam. If the standard sequence of access platform removal is followed, the beam is one of the last components to come out. Also, the beam cannot be safely removed until either the 50-1 or 50-2 entry level platforms are removed. Since other scheduled work was in process, requiring the entry level platforms, the beam was temporarily and intentionally left resting against the 1307 bulkhead for approximately 40 minutes. Due to the elapsed time and remote location of the beam, plus reduced lighting, the beam was forgotten and overlooked.  

        The check and balance by the technician and the Quality Control inspector failed. The technician and inspector were using a job card matrix, consisting of prerecorded platform component numbers which had been initially recorded during platform component installation. The removal check-off and accountability operation was being performed at floor level as opposed to the more traditional method of verification where the platform components are removed and verified as they cross the access ' door thresholds. The rationale for this change consisted of three considerations: (A) the bay was destined for maintenance rather than early roll-in of the next orbiter and, therefore, the platform components had to be completely removed from the work site and stowed; (B) the area where the platform components would have been inventoried and temporarily stowed was congested; (C) an opinion existed that a better check-off and accountability could be accomplished at the floor level rather
      than at the 50-1 and 50-2 access door exits.  
      
    The team responsible for job card matrix execution and ultimate removal verification consisted of one technician and one inspector. Several technicians were transporting the platform set assemblies from the 50-1 and 50-2 doors to the floor. As the technician read component part numbers, the quality inspector checked off the pre-recorded matrix. There were reported confusion factors consisting of multiple numbers on components and faded numbers; however, there was no practical correlation between these factors to explain why an error in accounting for the platform components occurred. For an unknown reason, the G070-502677-001 beam was counted as having been removed, and therefore, no subsequent search for it was made.  
      
    A probable scenario for the human error follows: piece number G070-502777-001 was mistakenly checked off the inventory list as G070-502677-001. After almost the entire inventory of platforms had been completed, the Tech and QC on the OPP floor started to review the inventory list to account for several items that had not yet been verified. Piece number G070-502777-001 was still not verified. In reviewing the assemblage of components, the Tech and QC found G070-502777-001 in the equipment storage area and marked it off the inventory list. Thus, component G070-502777-001 was probably counted twice as two pieces of equipment. This scenario was not presented by the Tech or QC, but is the most probable sequence of events that the Board feels occurred.  "
